ab salom ab salom ip roma little after two o dock tm til almost sundown of the long still hot weary dead september afternoon die
y satin what miss coldfield still called die office because her father had called it that a dim hot airless room with the blinds au
closed and fi is ten ed for forty three sam mm because when she was a girl someone had believed that light and moving air
carried heat and that dark was always cooler and which as the sun shone fuller and fuller on that side of the house became latticed
with yellow slashes full of dust motes which quentin thought of as bang flecks of the dead old dried paint itself blown inward fi rom
the scaling blinds as wind t night have mown fli em there was a wistaria vine blooming for the sec caid time that summer on
a wooden trellis before ca ie window into which iar tows came now and th min random gusts making a dry vivid dusty sound before
going away and opposite quentin miss coldfield in the eternal black which she had worn for forty three years now whether for sister fot hoorn

the twice bloomed wistaria against the outer wall by the savage quiet september sun impacted distilled and hyper distilled into wh idi came now and
then the loud cloudy flutter of the sparrows like a flat limber stick whipped by an idle boy and a e rank smell of female
old flesh long em bat ded in virginity while the wan haggard face watched him above the it triangle of lace at wrists and throat
om the too tall chair in which she resembled a cx uci fled child and the voice not ceasing but vanishing into and then out
of the long intervals like a stream a trickle running horn patch to patch of dried s and and the ghost mused with shadowy dod

most had td h ng him about old ghost times and the quentin comp son who was still too young to deserve yet to be
a ghost but nevertheless having to be one for all that since he was bom and bred in the deep south the same as she

this seems that his demon his name was s ut pen colonels ut pen colonels ut pen who came out of nowhere and without warning

tell me miss coldfield said so i dont in tag in e you will ever comeback here and set de down as a country lawyer
in al it de town like j ebf ek on since northern people have already ska to it that there is little left in dieu
th f bra young manso maybe you will enter die literary pr tft son as so many southern gende me a and gende women too
are doing now and maybe someday you will remember this and write about it you will be married then i expect and perhaps your wife
will want a new gown or a new chair for the house and you can write di is and submit it to them a zines
perhaps you will even remember kindly then the old woman who made you spend a whole afternoon sitting indoors and listening while she talked about
people and events you were fortunate enough to escape yourself when you wanted to be out among young friends of your own yes sum quentin
said only she dont mean that he drought its because she wants it told it was still early then he had yet in his pocket
the note which he had received by the hand of a small boy just before noon asking him to call and see her the quaint
stiffly formal request which was actually a summons out of another world almost the queer arch ric sheet of ancient good notepaper written over with
the neat faded cramped script which due to his astonishment at the request from a woman three rimes his age and whom he had known
all his life without having exchanged a hundred words with her or perhaps to the act that he was only twenty years old he did
not recognize as revealing a character cold implacable and even ruthless he obeyed it immediately after the noon meal walking the half mile between his
home and her s through die dry dusty heat of early september and so into the house it too was somehow smaller than its actual
a zeit was of two story sun painted and al it de shabby yet with an air a quality of grim endurance as though like
her it had been created to fit into and complement a world in all ways al it de smaller than the one in which it
found it see there in the gloom of the shut toed hallway whose air was even hotter than outside a sift hoe were prison ed
in it like in atom bau the sus pi ration of slow heat aden time wh idi had recurred during the forty five years lie
an all figure in black vd ach did not eve a ros de die wan triangle of lace at wrists and dir oat the d
imf ece looking at him with an expression speculative argent and intent waited to invite him in j its because she wants it told he
thought so that people whom she will never see and whose names she will never har and who have never heard her name nor seen
her face will read it and know at last why god let us lose the wan that only through die blood of our men and
the tears of our women could he stay this demon and efface his name and lineage from the earth then a lmn st immediately he
decided that nei die r was this the reason why she had sent the note and sending it why to him since is he had
merely wanted it told written and even printed she would not have needed to call in anybody z woman who even in his quentin s
fath ars youth had already established herself as the towns and the county s poetess laureate by issuing to the stem and meer sub scrip
don k st of the county newspaper poems ode eulogy and epitaph out of some bitter and implacable reserve of un de fiat it would
be three hours yet before he would learn why die had sent for him because part of it the first part of it quai tina
heady knew it was apart of his twenty years heritage o breathing the same air and hearing his fit her talk about the mans ut
pena part of the towns jeffersons eighty years heritage of die same air which the man himself had breathed bet wem this september afternoon in
and that sunday morning in june in when he first rode into town out of no discernible past and acquired his land noone knew how
and built his house his mansion appa rend you t of nothing and married elk n coldfield and be go this two chu drenthe son
who widowed the daughter who had not yet been a bride and so accomplished his allotted course to its violent miss coldfield atleast would have
said just cod ii qo eat in had grownup with that theme renames were m te khan ge able and almost myriad hh childhood was
full of than his very body was an empty hall echoing with sonorous d dee a ted name she was not a being an entity
he was a commonwealth he was a barrack filled with stubborn back looking ghosts still recovering even forty three yea is a fier ward fi
rom the fever which had cured the disease waking from the fever without even knowing that it had been the fever itself which they had
fought against and not the sickness looking with stubborn recalcitrance backward beyond the fever and into the disease with actual regret weak from the fever
yet free of the disease and not even aware that the freedom was that of impotence but why tell me about i the said to
his fet her that ev rai it gw hm he returned home after she had dismissal him at last with his promise to return for
her in the b ty why tell me about it what is it tome that the land of the earth or whatever it was got
tired of him at last and turned and destroyed him what if it did destroy her family too its going to turn and destroy us
all someday whether our name happens to be s ut pen or coldfield or not ah mr comp son said years ago we in the
so ah made our women into ladies i hen the war came and made the ladies m to ghost eso what else can we do
be mg geode men but listen to them being ghosts then he said o you want to know the real reason why she chose you
they were sitting on the gallery after a ip per waiting for the time miss coldfield had set for quentin to call for her its
because she will need someone togo with he ramana gende many et one still young e not to dow hu u die wants do it

you par dy responsible th roth heredity for what happened to her and her family through him whatever her reason fi jr choosing him whether
it was that or not the getting to it quentin thought was taking along time meanwhile as though in inverse ratio to the vanishing voice
the invoked ghost of the man whom she co nld neither forgiven or revenge her s df upon began to assume a quality almost of
solidity permanence itself ci ratm am heat and enclosed by it sef flu vi um of hell it saura of un rene ration it mused
mused thought seemed top oss s sentience as if though dispossessed of the p race who was impervious anyhow to fot i gue which she
declined to g veit it was st ff l irrevocably outside the scope of her hurt or harm with that quality peaceful and now harmless
and not even very attentive the ogre h ape which as miss cold fid ds voice went on resolved out of itself before quentin s
eyes the two half ogre children the three of them forming a shadowy background for die fourth one i his was the mother tie dead
sistere hen this niobe without tears who had con cd ved to the demon in a kind of nightmare who even while al ve had
moved but without bf o and grieved but without weeping who now had an air of tranquil and unwitting desolation not as if she had
d th a outlived the others or had died first but as if she had never lived at all quentin seemed to see them the
four of them arranged into the conventional fen u ly group of the period with formal and h less decorum and seen no was the
fading and ancient photograph itself would have been seen enlarged and hung on the wall behind and above the voice and of whose presence there
the voices owner was not even aware as if she miss coldfield had never seen this room before a picture a group which even to
quentin had a quality strange contra diao ry and bizarre not quite con i pre hens i ble note vai to twenty quite right a
group the last member of which had been dead twenty five years and the first fifty evoked now out of the airless gloom of a
dead house between an old womans grim and implacable unforgiving and the passive chafing of a youth of twenty telling himself even amid the voice
maybe you have to know anybody aw j it l well to love them but when you have hated somebody for forty three years you
will know the maw jul well so maybe its better then maybe its fine then because after fn iy t kree years they con i
any longer surprise you or md he you d die r vary contented or very mad aad maybe it the voice the talking the incredulous
and unbearable amazement had even been a cry aloud once quentin th out long a gov the new as a girl of young and indomitable
un regret of indictment of blind circumstance and savage ev mt but not now now only the lond y thwarted old female fled ie mr
bt it ded for forty three years in the old insult the old unforgiving outraged and betrayed by the final and complete afl sr on
t which was s ut pens death he wasn tag end tan an he wasnt eve nagai de mam he came he fe with a
horse and two pistols and a name which nobody ever heard before knew fin cca tai a was his own anymore than the horse was
his own or eva i the pistols seeking someplace to hide himself andy ok napa taw pha county supplied him with i the sought the
guarantee of reputable men to barricade him from the other and later strangers who might come seeking him in turn and jefferson gave him that
then he needed respectability the shield of a virtuous woman to make his position impregnable even against the men who had given him protection on
that inevitable day and hour when even they must rise gain st him in scorn and horror and outrage and it was mine and ellen
sfr it her who gave him that oh i hold no brief for ellen blind romantic fool who had only youth and in experience to
excuse her even if that blind romantic fool then later blind woman mother fool whe as he no longer had either youth or in experience
to excuse her when she lay dying in that house for which she had exd ian ged pride and peace both and nobody there but
the daughter who was sj ready the same as a widow without ever having bn a bride and was three years later to be a
widow sure enough without having been anything at all and the son who had repudiated the very roof under which he had been bom and
to which he would return but once more before disappearing for good and that as a murderer and almost a fratricide and he fiend blackguard
and devil m virginia fighting where the chances of the earths be ingrid of him were the best anywhere im der the sun yet eu
mandi both knowing that he would return that everyman in our armies would have to foil before bullet or ball found him and only i
a child a child mind you four years younger than the very niece i was asked to save for eu en to turn to and
say protect her protect judith atleast yes blind romantic fool who did not even have that hundred miles of plantation which apparently moved our father
north at big house and the notion of slaves under js xt day and night which reconciled i wont say moved her aunt no just
the btc e of a man who contrived somehow to swagger even on a horse a man who s of aras anyone including the father
who was to give him ada rh ter in marriage knew d the r had no past at all or did not dare reveal it
a man who rode into town out of nowhere with a horse and two pistols and a herd of wild beasts that he had hunted
down single handed because he was stronger in fear than even they were in whatever heath m place he had fled fe om and that
french architect who looked like he had be m hunted down and caught in turn by the a man who fled here and hid concealed
himself behind respectability behind hat hundred miles of land which he took from a tribe of ignorant indians nobody know show and a house the
size of a courthouse where he lived for three years without a window or door or bedstead in it and still c edits ut pens
hundred as if it had been a kings grant in unbroken perpetuity om his great grandfather a home position a wife and f emily which
being necessary to concealment he accepted along with the rest of respectability as he would have accepted the necessary disco m fert and even pain
of the briers and thorns in a thicket if the th id ret could have ven him the protection he sought no not even a
gentleman marrying ellen or marrying ten thousand ellens could not have made him one not that he wanted to be one or even betaken for
one no that was not necessary since all he would need would be ellens and our fe thar s names on a wedding license or
on any other patent of respectability hat people could look at and readjust as he would have wanted our fet her sora nyo thar reputable
i pans signature on a note of hand because our father knew who lus fet her was in tm nes see and who his grand
fet her had been in v uni a and our nei hors and the ple we lived among knew that we knew and we knew
they knew we knew and we knew that they would have believed us about whom and where he came iom even if we had lied
just as anyone could have looked at hit ri once and known that he wot il d belying about who and where and why he
came from by the vay fret that appa ra it ly he had to refuse to say at all and the very fact that he
had had to choose respectability to hide behind was proof enough if anyone needed further proof that what he fled from must have been some
opposite of respectability too dark to talk about because he was too young he was just twenty five andaman of twenty five does not voluntarily
undertake the hardship and privation of dear ir virgin laud and establishing a plantation in a new country just for money not a young man
without any past that he apparently cared to discuss in mississippi in with a river full of steamboats loaded with drunken fi ol s covered
with diamonds and benton throwing away their cotton and slaves before the boat reached new orleans not with all this just one nights hard ride
away and the only handicap or obstacle being the other blackguards or the risk of being put ashore on a sandbar and at die remotest
a hemp rope and he was no younger son sent out from some old ju iet country like virginia or caro hn a with the
surplus to take up newland because anyone could look at those of his and tell that they may have come and probably did from amu
idi older country than virginia or carolina but it wasnt a quiet one and anyone could have looked on a a this face and known
that he would have chosen the river and even the certainty of the hemp rope to undertaking what he undertook eva i if he had
known that he would find gold buried and waiting for him in the very land which he had bought noi hold no more brief for
ellen than ido for my seki home ven less for myself because i had had twenty years in which to watch him where ellen had
had but five and not even those five to see him but only to hear at secondhand what he was doing and not even to
hear more than half of that since apparently half of what he actually did during those five years nobody at all knew about and half
of the remainder no man would have repeated to a wife let alone a young girl he came here and setup a rare e show
which lasted five years and je fier son paid him for the entertainment by atleast shielding him to the extent of not telling their womenfolks
what he was doing but i had had all my life to wat ph him in since apparently and for what reason heaven has not
seen fit to divulge my life was destined to end on an afternoon in april f br tyl h ree years ago since anyone who
even had as ht de to call hv in gas i had had up to that time would not call what i have had since
hvm gi saw what had happened to ellen my sister is a wher almost a red use watching those two doomed children growing up whom
she was helpless to save is aw the price which she had paid for that house and that pride is aw the notes of hand
on pride and contentment and peace and all to which she had put her signature when die walked into the church that night begin to
fall due in succession is aw judith s marriage forbidden without rhyme or reason or shadow of eim use is a well a i die
with only me a child to turn to and ask to prot the r remaining child is aw henry repudiate his home and birthright and
then rectum and practically fling the bloody corpse of his asters sweetheart at the he m of her wedding gown is aw that man return
the evils source and head which had outlasted all its victims who had created two di il drain ot only to destroy one another and
his own line but my line as well yet agreed to marry himno i hold no brief for my s df ii dont plead youth
since iw ht creature indie south since ii mati woman or mule tad tad time or opportunity not only to t ave been young but
to have heard what being young was like bom those who had i dont plead propinquity a e fact r bati a woman young and
at the age for marrying and in a rim ft when most of the young men who mi would have known ordinarily were dead on
lost battlefields that i lived for two years under the same roof with him i dont plead material necessity the feet that an orphan a
woman and a pauper i turned naturally not for protection but for actual food to my only kin my dead sisters family though i defy
anyone to blame mean orphan of twenty a young woman without resources who should desire not only to justify her situation but to vindicate the
honor of a family the good name of whose women has never been impugned by accepting the honorable pro fier of marriage from the man
whose food she was forced to subsist on and most of all ido not plead myself a young woman emerging fi roma holocaust which had
taken parents security and from her who had seen all di at living meant to her fell into ruins about the feet of a few
figures with the shapes of men but with the names and statures of heroes a young woman i say town into daily and hourly contact
with one of the semen who despite w la the might have been at one tin se and despite what she might have b die
ved or even known about him had fought r four honorable years for the soil and traditions of the land where she had he m
bom and the man who had done that villain dyed though he be would have possessed in her eyes even if only fi rom association
with them the stature and shape of a hero too and now he also emerging fi rom the same ho loc amt in which she
had suffered with nothing to fern what the fu tur held for the south but his bare hands and the sword which heat lt had
never surrendered and the citation fir valor fir omi us defeated cot nm and cr mc bie oh he was brave i have never gainsaid
that but that our cause our very life and future hopes and past pride should have been thrown into the balance with men like that
to buttress it men with valor and strength but without pity or honoris it any won da that heaven saw fit to let us lose
nome quentin said but that it should have been our father mine and ellens father of all of them that he knew out of all
the ones who used togo out there and drink and gamble wi di him and watch him fight those wild whose daughter she might even
have won at cards that it should have been our father how he could have approached papa on what grounds what die re could have
been besides the common civ ih ty of two men meeting on the street between a man who came fi rom nowhere or dared not
tdl where and our father what there could have been between an a an like that and papa a methodist steward a merchant who was
not rich and who not only could have done nothing um ler the son to advance his fortunes or pr rape ct s but could
by no stretch df the imagination even have owned anything that he would have wanted even picked up in the road raman who owned nd
the rl and nor slaves except two house servants whom he had fie ed as soon as he got them bought them who neither drank
nor hunted nor gambled what there could have been between a man who to my certain knowledge was never in a jef if ers on
church but three times in his life the once when he first saw ellen the once w hm they rdi ears ed the wedding die
on tte when they performed it an w n that anyone could look at and see that even if he appa rend y had none
now he was accustomed to having money and intended to have it a gam and would have no scruples about how he got it that
man to discover ellen inside a church in di urch mind you as though there were a fatality and curse on our family and god
himself were seeing to it that it was performed and d is di arge d to the last drop and d reg yes fatality and
curse on the south and on our family as though because some ancestor of ours had elected to establish his descent in a land primed
for fatality and already an sed wit i hit even if it had not rather been our family our fathers progenitors who had incurred the
c une long years before and had been coerced by heaven into establishing itself in the land and the time already cursed so that even
i a child still too young to know more than that though ellen was my own sister and henry and judith my own nephew and
niece i was not even togo out there save when papa or my aunt was with me and that i was not to play with
henry and judith at all except in the house and not because i was four years younger than judith and six years younger dian henry
wasnt it to meth a tell rai turned before she died and said protect them even i used to wonder what our father or his
father could have done h fore he married our mother that ellen and i would have to expiate and neither of us alone be sufficient
what crime committed that would leave our family cursed to be instruments not only for that mans destruction but for our own yes sum quentin
said yes the gr ku quiet voice said from beyond the un moving triangle of dim lace and now among the mu mig and decorous
wraiths quentin seemed to watch resolving the figure of a little girl in the prim skirts and pantal et tes the smooth prim decorous braids
of the dead time she seemed to stand to lurk behind the neat picket fence of a small grimly middle dass yard or lawn looking
out upon the whatever ogre world of that quiet village street with that air of children bom too late into their parents lives and doomed
to cx n template all human behavior through the complex and needless follies of adults an air cassandra hk e and humorless and profoundly and
sternly prophetic out of all proportion to the actual years eve a of adu ld who had never been young because i was bom too
late i was bom twenty two years too late a child to whom out of the overheard talk of adults my own sisters and my
sisters childrens fes had come to be like the faces in an ogre tale between st q j per and bed long before i was
old enough or big enough to be permitted to play with them yet to whom that sister must have to turn at last when she
lay dying with one of die children vanished and doomed to be a murderer and the other doomed to be a widow before she had
even been a bride and say protect her atleast atleast save judith a child yet whose childs vouchsafed instinct could make that reply which the
mature wisdom of her elders appa rend y could not make protect here from whom and from what e he has already given them life
he does not need to harm them further it is from themselves that they need protection it should have be m later than it was
it should have be m late yet the yellow slashes of mote pal pit ant sunlight were latticed no hig lter up the impalpable wall
of gloom wh idi separated them the sun seemed hardly to have moved it foetal king foe telling seemed to him to quentin to partake
of that logic and reason flouting quality of a dream which foe sleeper knows must have occurred sti ubom and complete in a second yet
foe very quality upon which it must depend to move foe dr kt mer verisimilitude to c red uk t jr horror or pleasure or
amazement depends as completely upon af om mi recognition of and acceptance of dap sed and yet elapsing time as muti cora printed tale yes
i was bom took tei was a child who was to remember those three foc es and his too as seen for foe first time
in foe carm geon that first sunday morning when this town finally realized that he had turned that road from s ut pens hundred into
the church into a race trade i was three then and doubtless i had seen them before i must have but ido not remember it
ido not even remember ever having seen ellen before that sunday it was as though the sister who mi had never laid eyes on who
before i was bom had vanished into the s troi old of an ogre or a djinn was now to return through a disp a
is ation of one day only to the world which she had quitted and i ad ii ld of three waked early for the occasion
dressed and curled as if for christmas for an occasion more serious than christmas even since now and at last this ogre or djinn had
agreed for the sake of the wife and the children to come to church to permi them atleast to approach he vicinity of salvation to
atleast give eden one chance to struggle wi h him for hose childrens souls on a battleground where she could be supported not only by
heaven but by her own f emily and people of her own kind yes even for he moment submitting himself to redemption or lacking hat
atleast chivalrous for he instant even hough still un rene rate i hat is what i expected this is what is a was i stood
here before he church between papa and our aunt and waited for he car rip to arrive from he tw dv emile drive and hough
i must have seen ellen and he dr il d ren before his his is he vision of my first sight of he m which
shall carry to my grave a glimpse like he forefront of a tornado of he car rise and ellens high white face within it and
he two replicas of his face in miniature flanking her and on he front sea the face and tee h of he wild who was
driving and he his free exactly like he negros save for he tee h his became of his beard doubtless all in ah under and
a fir ry of wild eyed horses and of galloping and of dust oh hoe were pen ty of he m to a be it
him a is tid m make a race of it te no clock on sunday morning the carriage racing on two wheels up to the
very door to the chur di with that wild no in his christian dol he s looking exactly like a per r ming tiger in
a linen duster and a toph at and ellen with no drop of blood in her face holding those two children who were not crying
and who did not need to beheld who sato neither si of her per fe o ly still too within their faces that infantile enormity
w hid h we did not then quite comprehend oh yes there were plenty to aid and abet him even he could not have held
a horserace with oi w someone to race against because it was not even public opinion that stopped him not even the men whom ht
have had wives and children in carriages to be ridden down and into ditches it was the minister himself speaking in the name of the
women of jefferson andy ok napa taw pha county so he quit coming to church himself now it would be just ellen and the children
in the carriage on sunday mornings owe knew now that atleast there would be no betting now since noone could say if it was an
actual race or not since now with his fi ice absent it was only the wild negros perfectly in toru table one with the teeth
glinting al it de so that now we could never know if it were a race or a runaway and if there was triumph it
wa on the face twelve miles bach there at s ut pens hundred which did not even require to sec or be present it was
the now who in the act of passing another carriage spoke to that team too as well as to his own something wi di out
words not needing words probably in that tongue in which they slept in the mudd t that swamp and brought here out of whatever dark
swamp he had found them in and brought them here the dust the th tm der the carriage whirling up to the chur dido or
while women and children mattered and s cr to med before it and men caught at the bridles of the other team and then row
ot i idle teen and the children out at the door and take the carriage on su round to the hitching grove and beat the
horses for running away there was even a fool who tried to interfere once wha e upon die turned upon him with die stick lifted
and his teeth dio wing a little and said marsters a yi do you tell mars ter yes from them from themselves and this time
it was not even the minister it was ellen our aunt and papa were talking and i came in and my aunt said go out
and play di ough even if i could not have heard through the door at all i could have repeated die conversation for them your
daughter your own dai h term y aunt said and papa yes she is my daughter when she wants me to interferes he will tell
meso her s df because this sunday when ellen and the child r came out of the front door it was not the carri waiting
it was ellens phaeton with the old gende mare which she drove and the stab k boy that he had both t instead of the
wild and judith looked once at the phaeton and real i aed what it meant and began to scream screaming and kicking while they carried
her back into the house and put hex to bed no he was not present nord oi claim a lurking triumphant free behind a window
curtain probably he would have been as amazed as we were since we would all realize now di at we were fec ed by more
than a childs tantrum or even hysteria that his free had be oi in that carriage all the time that it had be a i
judi iha girl of sbc v dio had in stated and authorized that no to make the team runaway not henry mind not the boy
which wo idd have been outrageous enough but judith the girl as so cm as papa and i entered those gates tl taf remo on
and began togo up the drive toward the house i could fed kit was as though somewhere in that sunday afternoons niet and peace the
screams of that d bdd still existed lingo ed not as sot md now but as something for the skin to hear the hair on
the head to hear but i did not ask at once i was just four then is at in the buggy beside papa as i
had stood between him and our aunt before tie church on that first sunday when i had been dressed to come and see my sister
and my nephew and niece for the first time looking at the house i had been inside it before too of course but even when
is a wit for foe first time that i could remember i seemed already to knowhow it was going to look just as i seemed
to knowhow ellen and judith and henry would look before is aw them for foe time which i always remember as being foe first no
not asking even then but just looking at that huge quiet house saying what room is judith sick in papa with that quiet aptitude of
a foil d for accepting foe inexplicable though i now know that even then i was wondering what judith saw when she came out foe
door and found foe phaeton instead of foe carriage foe tamest able boy instead of foe wildman what she had seen in du t phaeton
wh kh looked so i ono cent to foe rest of us or worse what she had missed when she saw foe phaeton and began
to scream yes a still hot quiet sunday if te moon like this afternoon i remember yet foe utter quiet of that house when we
went in and from which i knew at once that he was absent without knowing that he would now be in foes cup pemon garb
or drinking with wash jones i only knew as soon as papa and i crossed foe th ref o old that he was not there
as though vd fo some almost omniscient conviction knowing that he did not need to stay and observe his triumph and that in comparison with
what was to be this one was a mere trivial business even beneath our notice too yes that quiet darkened room with foe bl info
dosed and a woman sitting beside foe bed with a fen and judith s white fec eon the pillow bene a fo a camphor doth
a deep as i supposed then possibly it was sleep or would be called sleep and e he nsf ece white and calm and papa
said go out and find henry and ask him to play wi di you rosa and so i stood just outside that quiet door in
that quiet upper hah because i was afi raid togo away even from it because i could hear the s abba di afternoon quiet of
that house louder than thunder louder than laughing even with triumph think of the children papa said thinks e hen said w lia td be
doi do what else doi lie awake at night and do but think of diem s neither papa nore hen said comeback home not his
occurred before it became fashionable to repair your mistakes by turning your back on them and running it was just the two quiet voices beyond
that blank door which might have been discussing something printed in a magazine and i a child standing close beside that door because i was
afi raid to be there but more afi raid to leave it standing motionless beside that door as though trying to make myself blend with
the dark wood and become invisible like a cham de on listening to the living spirit presence of that house since some of e hms
life and breath had now gone into it as we has his breathing away in along neutral sound of victory and despair of triumph and
terror too do you love this papa said papa ellen said that was all but i could see her fi ice then as clearly as
papa could have with that same expression which it had worn in the carriage on that first sunday and the others then a servant came
and said our buggy was ready yes e rom themselves not fi rom him not fi romany body just as nobody could have saved them
even him sd fi because he now showed us why that triumph had been beneath his notice he show ellen that is not me was
not the ce it was six years now during which i had scarcely seen him our aunt was gone now and i was keeping house
for papa perhaps once a year papa and i would go out there and have dinner and maybe four times a year ellen and the
ch ddr en would come in and spend the day with usno the that i know of he never entered dns house again after he
and ellen married was young the niwa seven young enough to believe that this was due to some stubborn coal of conscience if not remorse
even in him but i know better now i know now that it was simply because since papa had given him respectability through a wife
there was nothing eke he could want from papa and so not even sheer gratitude let alone appearances could force him to forego his own
pleasure to the extent of taking a family meal with his wifes people so is awl it de of the mi did not have time
now to play even if i had ever had any inclination i had never learned how and is aw no reason to try to learn
now even if i had had the time so it was six years now though it was actually no secret to ellen since it had
apparently been going on ever since he drove the last nail in the house the only difference between now and the time of his bach
dor hood being that now they would hitch the te an is and saddle hones and mules in the grove beyond the stable and so
come across the pasture unseen from the house because there were plenty of them still it was as if god or the devil had taken
advantage of his very vices in order to supply witnesses to the discharge of our curse not only from among gentlefolk sour own kind but
from the very scum and rifle ir who could not have approach ol the house itself under any other circumstances not even from tiff i
rear yes ellen and those two children alone in that house twelve miles from town and down dbe re in the stable a hollow square
of feces in the kn tem light the white as feces on three ades the black one son the fourth and in the center two
of his wild fighting naked fighting not s white men fight with rules and weapons but as n roes fight to hurt one another quick
and bad ellen knew that or thought she did that was not it she accepted that not reconciled accepted as though there is a breathing
point in outrage where you can accept it almost with gratitude s in re you can say to yourself thank god this is all atleast
i now know all of it thinking that clinging still to that when she ran into the stable that night while the very men who
had stolen into it fi rom the rear fell back away fi rom her with atleast some grain of decency and ellen seeing not the
two black beasts she had expected to see but instead a white one and a black one both naked to the waist and gouging at
one another s eyes as if they should not only have been the same color but dio ul d have been covered with fur to
oy it seems that on certain occasions perhaps at the end of the evening the spectacle as a grand finale or perhaps as a matter
of sheer deadly forethought toward the retention of supremacy domination he would enter the ring wt it hone of the him s df yes that
s what efl en saw her hm band and the father of her child rai standing there naked and panting and bloody to the waist
and he just feu en evidently lying at hh feet and bloody too saveh at on the it mer dy looked like grease or sweat
e hen running down the hill from the hou bareheaded in time to hear the sound the screaming hearing it while she still ran in
the darkness and before the spectators knew hats he was the rehearing it even before it occurred to one spectator to say t tsa horse
th mit saw roman then my god it sadi il dr an in and the spectators felling back to permit her to sec henry p
lun out fi rom among the who had been holding him scream it and vomiting not pausing not even lookup at the faces which shrank
back away from her as she knelt in the stable filth to raise henry and not looking at henry ei tier but up at him
as he stood there with even his teeth showing beneath his beard now and another wiping the blood from his body with a tows a
cli know you will excuse us gentlemen men said but they were already departing and white slinking out again as they had slunk in and
eu en not watch ii them now either but kneeling in the dirt while henry dung to her crying and he standing there yet while
a third prodded his shirt or coat at him as though the coat were a stick and he a caged snake where is judith thomas
e ellen said judith he said oh he was not lying his own triumph had outrun him he had build ed even better in evil
than even he could have hoped judith isnt she in bed dont lie tome thomas ellen said i can understand your bringing hairy here to

a voice calm and sweet and filled with despair judith honey time to come to bed but i was not there i was not there
to see the two s ut pen faces this time once on judith and once on the girl beside her looking down through the square
entrance to the loft ii it was a summer of wistaria the wil ht was full of it and of t lie smell of his
fad i ers cigar as they s at on tie front gallery after supper until it would be time for quentin to start while in
the deep shaggy lawn b dow tie veranda tie fireflies blew and drifted in soft random tie odor the scent which five months later mr
comp sons letter would carry up fi rom mississippi and over the long iron new england snow and into quentin s sitting room at harvard
it was a day of listening too tie listening the hearing in mostly about that which he a iea dyk new since he had been
bom in and s tiu breathed tie same air in which tie church bells had rung on that sunday morning in st don sundays heard
even one of the original three bells in the same steeple where descendants of the same pigeons st tutte d and crooned or wheeled in
short courses resembling soft fluid paint smears on the soft summer sky that sunday morning in june with the bells ringing peaceful and peremptory and
a litt b cacophonous the denominations in concord thou not in tune and the ladies and children and house to carry the parasols and fl
r whisks and even a few man the ladies moving in hoops sun ong the miniature broadcloth of little boys and the pantal et tes
of little girls in the skirts of the time when ladies did not walk but floated when the other men sitting with th dr feet
on the railing of the holston house gallery looked up and there the stranger was he was already halfway across the square when they saw
him on a big hard ridden roan horseman and beast looking as though they had been created out of thin air and set dots min
the bright summer sabbath sunshine in the middle of a tired foxtrot face and horse that none of them had ever seen before name that
none of them had ever heard and origin and purpose which some of them were never to learn so that indie next four w k
sef fer son was a village then the holston house the courthouse six stores a blacksmith and livery stable a saloon frequented by drovers and
peddlers three churches and perhaps thirty residences the strangers name went back and forth among the places of business and of idleness and among the
residences in steady strophe and anti strophes ut pens ut pens ut pens ut pen that was all that the town was to know about
him for almost a month he had appa rend y come into town from the southam an of about twenty five as die town learned
later because at the time his age could not have been guessed because he looked like a man who had been side not like a
man who had been peacefully ill in bed and had recovered to move with a sort of diffident and tentative amaze mo it in a
world which he had b die ved himself on the point of surrendering but like a man who had been through some solitary furnace experience
which was more than just fever bke an explorer say who not only had to face the normal hardship of the pursuit which he chose
but was overtaken by the added and unforeseen handicap of the fever also and fought through it at enormous cost not so much physical as
mental alone and unaided and not through blind instinctive will to endure and survive but to gain and keep to enjoy it the material pri
a for which he accepted the original gambit a man with a big frame but gaunt now almost to emaciation with a short reddish beard
which resembled a disguise and above which las pale eyes had a quality at once visionary and alert ruthless and reposed in a btc e
whose flesh had the appearance of pottery of having been colored by that ovens fever c it her of soul or environment deeper than sun
alone beneatha dead impervious surface as of glazed clay that was what they saw though it was years before the town learned that that was
all which he possessed at the time the strong spent horse and the clothes on his back and a small saddlebag scarcely large enough to
contain the spare linen and the razors and the two pistols of which miss coldfield told qua it in with the butts worn smooth as
pick handles and which he used with the precision of knitting needles later quentin s grandfather saw him ride at a canter around a sapling
at twenty feet and put both bullets into a playing card fastened to the tree he had a room in the holston house but he
carried the key with him and each morning he fed and saddled the horse and rode away before day lh t where to the town
likewise failed to learn probably due to the fact dia the gave die pistol demonstration on the d ii rd day after his arrival so
they had to depend on inquiry to find out what they could about him which would of necessity beat night at the supper table in
the holston house dining room or indie lounge which he would have to cross to gain his room and lock die door again which he
would do as soon as he finished eating the bar opened into the lounge too and that would or should nave been the place to
accost him and even inquire accept for the fi ict that he did not use the bar he did not drink at all he told
them he did not say that he used to drink and had quit north a the had nev ra used alcohol he just said that
he would not care for a drink it was years later before even quentin s grand f other he was a young man too then
it would be years yet before he would become gen aral comp sbn learned t the reasons ut pen did not drink was that he
did not have the money with which to pay his di are or return the courtesy it was general comp son who first realized that
at this times ut pen lacked not only the money to spend ford n nk and conviviality but the time and inclination as well that
he was at this time completely the slave of his secret and furious impatience his conviction gained fi rom whatever that recent experience had been
that fever mental or physical of a need for haste of time fled ng beneath him which was to drive him for the next five
years as general comp son computed it roughly until about nine months before his son was bom so they wo idd catch him run him
to earth in the lounge between the supper table and his locked door to give him the opportunity to tee them who he was and
where he came fi rom and what he was up to whereupon he would move gradually and steadily until his back came in contact with
something a post or a wall and then stand there and tell them nothing whatever as pleasantly and courteously as a hotel clerk it was
the chickasaw indian agent with or through whom he dealt and so it was not until he waked the county recorder that saturday nh t
with the deed patent to the land and the gold spanish coin that the town learned that he now owned a hundred square miles of
some of the best virgin bottom i md in the country though even that knowledge came too late because s ut pen himself was gone
where to again they did not know but he owned land among them now and some of them began to suspect what general comp son
apparently knew that the spanish coin with which he had paid to have his patent recorded was the last one of any kind which he
possessed so they were certain now that he had departed to get more there were several who even anticipated in be he ving and even
in saying aloud now that he was i not pre so it what s ut pens future and then unborn sister in law was to
tell quentin almost eighty years later that he had found some um que and practical way of hiding loot and that he had returned to
the cache to replenish his pockets even if he had not actually ridden with the two pistols back to the river and the steamboats full
of gamblers and cotton and slave dealers to replenish the cache atleast some of them were telling one another that when two months later he
returned a gam without warning and accompanied this time by the covered wagon with a driving it and on the seat with the a small
alertly resigned man with a grim harried latin face in a frock coat and a flowered waistcoat and a hat which would have created no
furor eon a pans boulevard all of which he was to wear const andy for the next two years the somberly the at ric clothing
and the expression of fatalistic and amazed determination while his white client and the crew which he was to advise though not direct went stark
naked save for a coating of dried mud this was the french arch it at years later the town learned that he had comeau the
way from martinique on s ut pens bare promise and lived for two years on venison cooked over a campfire in a nun floored tent
made of the wagon hood before he so much as saw any color or shape of pay and until he passed through town on his
way back to new orleans two years later he was not even to see jefferson again he would not come or s ut pen would
not bring him to town even on the few occasions when s ut pen would be seen die re and he did not have much
chance to look at jefferson on that first day because the wagon did not stop apparently it was only by sheer geographical hap that s
ut pen passed through town at all pausing only long enough for someone not general comp son to look beneath the wagon hood and into
a black tunnel filled with still eyeballs and smelling like awol file n but the legend of s ut pens wild was not to begin
at once because the wagon went on as though even die wood and iron which composed it as well as the mules which drew it
had become imbued by sheer association with him with that quality of gaunt and tireless driving that conviction for haste and of fleeing d me
later s ut pen told quentin s grand fi it her that on that afternoon when the wagon passed through je fier son they had
been without food since the previous night and that he was trying to reach s ut pens hundred and the river bottom to try to
kill a deer before dark so he and the architect and the would not have to spend another night without food so the legend of
the wild men came gradually back to town brought by the men who would ride out to watch what was going on who began to
tell how s ut pen would take stand beside a game trail with the pistols and send the into drive the swamp like a pack
of hounds it was they who told how during di at first summer and fall the did not even have or did not use blankets
to sleep in even before the coon hunter akers claimed to have walked one of them out of the absolute mud like a sleeping alligator
and screamed just in time the co um speak no english yet and doubtless there were more than akers who did not know that the
language in which they and s ut pen communicated was a sort off raid hand not some dark and fatal tongue of their own there
were many more than akers though the others were responsible citizens and landowners and so did not have to lurk about the camp at night
in fact as miss qa ld field tdd quentin they would makeup parties to meet at the holston house and go out horseback often carrying
lunch s ut pen had built a bride kiln and he had setup the saw and planer which he had brought in the won a
capstan with along sapling walking beam with the wagon team and the q groin shifts and him s df too when necessary when the machinery
slowed hitched to it as if the actually were wild mai as general comp son told his son quoit in s father while the were
workings ut pen never raised his voice at diem that instead he led them caught them at the psychological instant by example by some ascendancy
of forbear an re rather than by brute fear without dismounting usually s ut pen did not even greet them with as much asano d
appa ren dyas unaware of their presence as if they had been idle shades they would s it in a curious quiet dump as di
ough for mutual protection and watch his mansion rise carried plank by plank and brick by brick out of the swamp where the clay and
timber waited the bearded whiteman and the twenty black ones and all stark naked beneath the cro aching and pervading mud being men these spectators
did not realize that the garments which s ut pen had worn when he first rode into jefferson were the only ones in which they
had ever seen him and few of the women in the county had seen him at all otherwise some of them would have anticipated miss
coldfield in this too in divining that he was saving his do the s since decorum even if not elegance of appearance would be the
only weapon or rather ladder wi di which he could conduct the last assault upon what miss coldfield and perhaps others believed to be respectability
that respectability which according to gene rd comp son consisted in s ut pens secret mind of a great deal more than the mere acquisition
of a chat elaine for his house so he and die twenty worked together plastered over with mud against the mosquitoes and as miss coldfield
told quentin distinguishable one from another by his beard and eyes alone and only the architect resembling a human creature because of the french clothes
which he wore constantly with a sort of invincible tal it y until the day after the house was completed save for ti he window
gi as s and the ironware which they could not make by hand and the architect departed working in the sun and heat of summer
and the mud and ice of winter with quiet and unflagging fury it took him two years he and his crew of imported slaves which
his adopted fellow citizens still looked on as being a good deal more deadly than any be as the could have started and slain in
that country they worked from sunup to sundown while parties of horsemen rode up and s at their horses quietly and watched and the architect
in his formal coat and his parish at and his expression of grim and embittered amazement lurked about the en vi rom of the scene
with his air something between a casual and bitterly disinterested spectator and a condemned and conscientious ghost amazement general comp son said not at the
others and what they were doing so much as at himself at the in exp u cable and incredible fact of his own presence but
he was a good architect quentin knew the house twelve miles from jefferson in its grove of cedar and oak seventy five years after it
was finished and not only an architect as general comp son said but an artist since only an artist could have borne those two years
in order to build a house which he do ub des s not only e spec ted but firmly intended never to sees gain not
general comp son said the hard s mp to sense and the outrage to sensibility of the two years sojourn butsu t pen that only
an artist could have born es ut pens ruthlessness and hurry and still manage to curb the dream of grim and cas d dike magnificence
at wbc hsu t pen obviously aimed s in the place as s ut pen planned it would have been almost as lar as je
fier son itself at the time that the lit de grim harried fore ner had single handed given bat de to and vanquished s ut
pens fierce and overweening vanity or desire for nm gn if ice n ce or for v indica tio ii or whatever it was even
general comp son did not know yet and so created of s ut pens very defeat the victory which in conquering s ut pen himself
would have failed to gain so it was finished then down to the last plank and brick and vo oden pin which they could make
then a elves unpainted and unfurnished without a pane of glass or a doorknob or hinge in it twelve miles from town and almost that
far from any neighbor it stood for three years more surrounded by its formal gardens and promenades its slave quarters and stables and smokehouses wild
turkey ranged within a mile of the house and deer came hg ht and colored like smoke and left delicate prints in the formal beds
where there would be no flowers for four years yet now there began a period a phase during which the town and the county watched
him with more puzzlement yet perhaps it was because the nextstep toward that secret end which general comp son claimed to have known but which
the town and the county comp reh aided but dimly or not at all now required patience or passive time instead of that driving fury
to which he had accustomed them now it was the wo mai who first suspected what he wanted vh at the nextstep would be none
of the men certainly not those who knew him well enough to call him by name suspected that he wanted a wife doubtless there were
some of them hm bands and bachelors both who not only would have refused to entertain die idea but would even have protested gain st
it because for the next th rye are he led what must have been to them a perfect existence heh ved out there eight miles
from any neighbor in masculine solitude in what might be called the h acre gun room of a baronial splendor he lived in the spartans
he llc the largest edifice in the county not excepting the courthouse itself whose threshold no woman had so much as seal without any fe
mini zed softness of windowpane or door or mattress where there vr as not only no woman too hj ect if he should elect to
have his dogs into sleep on the pallet bed with him he did not even need dogs to hill the game which left footprints with
insight of the kitchen door but hunted it instead with human beings who belonged to him body and soul and of whom it was believed
or said that they could creep up to a bedded buck and cut its throat before it could move it was at this time that
he began to invite the parties of men of which miss coldfield told quentin out tosu t pens hundred to camp in blankets in the
naked rooms of his embryonic formal opulence they hunted and at night played cards and drank and on occasion he doubtless pitted his against one
another and perhaps even at this time participated now and then himself t that spec ta de which according to miss coldfield his son was
unable to bear the sight of while his daughter looked on unmoved s utp end rank himself now though there were probably others besides quentin
s grandfather who remarked that he drank very sparingly save when he himself had managed to supply some of the liquor his guests would bring
whiskey out with them but he drank of this with a sort of sparing calculation as thoth keeping mentally general comp son said a sort
of balance of spiritual solvency between the amount of whiskey he accepted and the amount of running meat which he supplied to the guns he
lived like that for three years he now had a plantation inside of two years he had dragged house and gardens out of virgin swamp
and plowed and planted his land with seed cotton which general comp son loaned him then he seemed to quit fife seemed to just s
it down in the middle of what he had almost fib ii ed and to remains of or three years during which he did not
even appear to in t aid or want any th more poh aps it is not to be won do red at that the men
in the county came to believe that the life he now led had be a i his aim all die time it was genial comp
son who seemed to have known him well enough to of if ec to lend him seed cotton for his start who knew any better
to whom s utp e never told anything about his past it was general comp son who knew first about the spanish coin being his
last one as it was comp son so the town learned later who offered to lends ut pen the money to finish and fiu m
ish his house and was refused so do ub des s general com f son was the first man in the county tote u himself
that s ut pen did not need to borrow money with which to complete the house supply what it yet lacked because he intended to
marry it not the first person to know rather the first man since according to what miss coldfield told quentin seventy five years later the
women in the county had been telling one another and their husbands as well that s ut pen did not intend to quit there that
he had already gone to too much trouble gone through too much privation and hard sh to set de down and live ex ac dyas
he had lived while the house was being built save that now he had a roof to sleep undo in place of a nun floored
won hood probably the women had already cast about among the f emilie s of the men whom ht now be called hk friends for
that prospective bride whose dowry might complete the shape and substance of that respectability miss cold fid d anyway believed to be his aim so
when at the expiration of this second phase three years as csx the house was finished and the architect departed and again on sunday morning
and again without warning the town saw him cx css the square on foot now but in the same garm mts in which he had
ridden into town five years ago and which noone had seen since ie or one of the had ironed the coat with heated bricks general
comp son told quentin sf ether and en to the methodist church y son m of the men were surprised the women merely said that
he had exhausted the possibilities of the f emilie s of the men with whom he had hunted and gambled and that he had now
come to town to find a wife exactly as he would have gone to the memphis market to buy livestock or slaves but when they
comprehended whom it was that he had apparently come to town and into church to invest with his choice the assurance of the women became
one with the mens surprise and then even more than that amazement because the town now believed that it knew him for two years it
had watched him as with that grim and unflagging fir ry he had erected that sh ch of a house and laid out his fields
then for three years he had remained completely static as if he were run by electricity and someone had come along and removed d is
mande d the wiring or the dynamo so that when he entered the methodist church that sunday morning in his ironed coat there were men
as well as women who believed that they had only to look around the congregation in order to anticipate the direction his feet would take
him until they became aware that he had appa rend y marked down jn fi is scold fields father with the same cold and ruthless
deh be ration with which he had probably marked down the french architect they watched in shocked amazement while he laid deliberate siege to the
one man in the town with whom he could have had nothing in common least of all money z man who obviously could do nothing
under the stm for him save give him credit at a litt fe crossroads store or casta vote in his favor if he dio ul
d ever seek ordination as a methodist minister z methodist steward a merchant not only of modest position and circumstances but who already had a
wife and family of his own let alone a dependent mother and sister to support out of the proceeds of a buri ness which he
had broth t to jer son ten years ago in a single wagon a man with a name for absolute and und c vi at
mg and even puritan up rightness in a country and time of lawless opportunity who neither drank nor gambled nor even hunted in their surprise
they forgot that mr coldfield had a marriageable daughter they did not consider the daughter at all they did not think of love in connection
with s ut pen they thought of ruthlessness rather than justice and of fear rather than respect but not of pity or love besides being
too lost m amazed speculation as to just how s ut pen intended or could contrive to use mr coldfield to further whatever secret end
she still had they were never to know even miss rosa coldfield did not because from that day there were no more hunt mg parties
out at s ut pens hundred and when they saw him now it would be in town but not loafing idl mg the men who
had slept and matched glasses with him under his roof some of them had even come to call him s ut pen without the formal
mister watched him pass along the street before the holston house with a single formal gesture to his hat and goon and enter mr coldfield
s store and that was au the none day he quitted jefferson for the second time mr comp son told quentin the town should have
been accustomed to that by now nevertheless his position had subtly changed as you will see by the towns reaction to this second return because
when he came back this time he was in a sense a pub hc enemy perhaps this was because of what he brought back with
him this time the material he brought back this time as compared to the simple wagon load of wild which he had brought back before
but i dont think so that is i think it was a little more involved than the sheer value of his chandeliers and mahogany an
drugs i think that the affront was bom of the towns realization that he was getting it involved with himself that whatever the felony which
product the mahogany and crystal he was forcing the town to compound it heretofore until that sunday when he came to church if he had
misused or injured anybody it was only old ikk emo tub be foom whom he goth island a matter between his conscience and uncle sam
and god but now his position had changed because when about three months after he departed four wagons left jef ter son togo to the
river and meet him it was known that mr coldfield was the man who hired and dispatched them they were big wagons drawn by oxen
and when they returned the town looked at them and knew no matter what they might have contained that mr coldfield could not have mortgaged
everything that he owned for enough to fill them doubtless this time there were more men than women even who pictured him during this absence
with a handkerchief over his f ocean d the two pistol barrels glinting be neal h the candelabra of a steamboats saloon even if no
worse if not something performed in the lurking dark of a muddy landing and with a knife from behind they saw him pass on the
roan horse beside his four wagons it seems that even the ones who had eaten his food and dio this game and even called him
s ut pen without the mister didnt accost him now they just waited while reports and rumors came bade to town of how he and
his now somewhat tamed had installed the sv in dow s and doors and the spits and pots in the kitchen and the crystal chandeliers
in the parlors and the furniture and the curtains and the rugs it was that same akers who had blundered on to the mud couched
five years ago who came a little wild eyed and considerably slack mouthed into he holston house barone evening and said boys this time he
stole the whole dum steamboat lso atlas td vic virtue came to a boe lone day and wi h he hoi ff of the county
a moi he ma party of d gh to rten took the road out tosu t pens hundred they did not go all the way
because about six miles from town they mets ut pen himself he was rid mg the roan horse in the frock coat and the beaver
hat vh ich they knew and with his legs wrapped ma piece of tar pau hn he had a portmanteau on ms pommel and he
was carrying a small woven basket on his arm he stopped the roan it was april then and the road was still a quagmire and
s at there in his splashed tarpaulin and looked from one face to the next your grandfather said that his eyes looked like pieces of
a broken plate and that his beard was strong as a currycomb that was how he put it strong as a currycomb good morning gentlemen
he said were you looking forme doubtless some t lung more than this transpired at the time though none of the vigilance committee ever told
it that i know of all i ever heard is how the town the men on the gallery of the holston house saws ut pen
and the committee ride on to the square together s ut pena little in front and the others bunched behind him s ut penwith his
legs and feet wrapped neatly in his tarpaulin and his shoulders squared inside the worn broad c lodi coat and that worn brushed beaver cocked
a little talking to them over his shoulder and those eyes hard and pale and reckless and probably quizzical and maybe contemptuous even a en
he pulled up at the door and a e hos der ducked out and took the roans head and s ut pen got down wi
a his portmanteau and the basket and mounted a e steps and i heard how he turned acre and looked at aem again where they
huddled on a eir horses not knowing what to do exactly and it might have been a good a ing that he had a at
beard and they could not see his mouth then he turned and he looked at a eo aer men sitting wi a a eir feet
on a e railing and watching him too men who used to come out to his place and sleep on a e floor and hunt
with him and he saluted them with that florid swaggering gesture to the hat yeshe was under bred it showed like this always your grandfather
said in all his formal contacts with people he was like john l sullivan having taught himself painfully and tediously to dodie sch ott is
che having drilled himself and drilled hii m elfin secret until he now believed it no longer necessary to count the music she at say
he may have believed that your grandfather or judge benbow might have done it al it demo reef for des sly than he but he
would not have believed that anyone could have beat him in knowing when to do it and how and besides it was in his face
that was where his power lay your grandfather said that anyone could look at him and say ci u en the o a as ion
and the need this man can and will do an ying then he went on into the house and commanded adb amber so they s
at on their horses and waited for him i suppose they knew that he would have to come out sometime i suppose they s at
there and thought about those two pistols because there was still no warrant for him you see it was just public opi nicki in an
acute state of indigestion and now other horsemen rc w le into the square and became aware of the situation so that there was quite
a posse waiting when he walked out on to the gallery he wore a ne what now and a new broadcloth coat so they knew
what the portmanteau had contained they eva i knew now what the basket had contained because he did not have that with him now either
doubtless at the time it merely puzzled them more than ever because you see they had been too busy speculating on just bow he was
planning to use mr coldfield and since his return too completely outraged by he belief that they now saw the results even if the means
were still an enigma to ron as m ber about miss lena tall so he stopped again doubtless and looked from face to face again
doubtless me moriz mg the new faces without any haste with sail the beard to hide whatever his mouth might have shown but he seems
to have said nothing at all this a me he just descended the steps and walked on across the square the committee your grandfather said
it had grown to almost fifty by nov moving too following him across the square they say he did not even look back he just
walked on erect with the ne what cocked and carrying in his hand now that which must have seemed to them the final gratuitous insult
with the committee riding along in the street beside him and not quite parallel ando the is who did not happen to have horses at
the moment joining in and following the committee in the road and ladies and d bild ren and women slaves coming to the doors and
windows of the homes as they passed to watch as they went on in grim tableau and s ut pens tiu without once looking back
mter ed mr coldfield s gate and strode on up the brick walk to die door carrying his newspaper cornucopia of dow ers they waited
for him a in the crowd was growing a st now other men and a few boys and even some noes from the adjacent houses
clotting behind the eight original members of the committee who s at watching mr coldfield s door until he emerged it was a good while
and he no longer carried the flowers and when he returned to the gate he was engaged to be married but they did not know
this and as soon as he reached the gate they arrested him they took him back to town with the ladies and children and house
watching from behind curtains and behind the sh nfl be ry in the yards and the comers of the houses the kitchens where doubtless food
was already beginning to scorch and so back to the square where the rest of the able boche d mm left their offices and stores
to foe ow so that when he reached the courthouses ut pen had a larger following than if he actually had been the runaway slave
they arraigned him before a justice but by that time your grandfather and mr coldfield had got there they signed his bond and late that
afternoon he returned home with mr coldfield walking along the same street as of the forenoon with doubtless the same faces watching him from behind
the window curtains to the betrothals upper with now in eat table and no whiskey before or after during none of his three passages that
day through that street did his bearing alter the same unhurried stride to which that new fi rock coat swung the same angle to the
ne what above the eyes and the beard your grandfather said that some of the fai en ce appearance which the flesh of his face
had had when he came to town five years ago was gone now and that his face had an honest sunburn and he was not
fleshier either your grandfather said that was not it it was just that the flesh on his bones had become quieter as though passive after
some actual breasting of atmosphere like in running so that he actually filled his clothes now with that quality stills wae ring but without bragg
a do cio or belligerence though according to your grand fi it her the quality had never been bd lig e rence only watchfulness and
now that was gone as though after the three years he could trust his eyes alone to do the watching without the flesh on his
bones standings entry also two months later he and miss eli an were married it was in june of almost five years to the day
fi rom that sunday morning when he rode into town on the roan horse it the wedding was in the same methodist church where he
saw ellen for the first time according to miss rosa the an nt had even forced or nagged not cooled that would not have done
it mr coldfield into allowing ellen to wear w daron her ce for the occasion the powder was to hide the marks of tears but
before the wedding was over the powder was streaked caked and channelled ellen seems to have entered the church di at night out of weeping
as though out of rain gone through the ceremony and then walked back out of the church and into the weeping again the tears again
the same tears even the same rain she got into the carriage and departed in it the rain for s ut pens hundred it was
the wedding which caused the tears not marrying s ut pen whatever tears there were for that granted there were tears came later it was
not intended to be a big wedding that is mr coldfield seems not to have intended it to be you will notice that most divorces
occur with women who were married by tobacco chewing jps in country courthouses or by ministers waked after midnight with the k suspenders showing beneath
their coat tails and no collar on and a wife or spinster sister in curl papers for wi mess so bit too much to believe
that these women come to long for divorce from a sense not of incompleteness but of actual frustration and betrayal that regardless of the breathing
evidence of children and all else they still have in their minds the image of themselves walking to music and turning heads in all the
symbolic al trappings and circumstance of ceremonial surrender of that which they no longer possess and why not since to them the actual and au
then ttc surrender can only be and has been a ceremony like the breaking of a banknote to buy a ticket for the tr tih
of the two men it was su tj cn who desired the big wedding the full ch mc hand all the lit u ali have
this from something your grandfather let drop one day and which he doubtless had from s utp rai himself in the same accidental fashion since
s ut pen never event old ellen that he wanted it and the fact that at the last minute he refused to support her in
her desire and insistence upon it accounts partly for the tears mr coldfield apparently intended to use the diu rdi into which he had invested
a certain amount of sacrifice and doubtless self denial and certainly actual labor and money for the sake of what might be called a demand
balance of spiritual solvency exactly as he would have used a cotton g in in which he considered himself to have incurred either interest or
responsibility for die ginning of any cotton which he or any member of his family by blood or by marriage had raised that and no
more pei i aps his wanting a small wedding was due to the same tedious and unremitting husbandry which had enabled him to support mother
and sister and marry and raise a family on the proceeds of that store which ten years ago had fitted into a single wagon or
perhaps it was some innate sense of delicacy and fitness which his sister and daughter did not seem to possess by the way regarding the
prospective son in law whom just two months ago he had been instrumental in getting out of j au but it was not due to
any lack of courage regarding the son in laws still anomalous position in the town regardless of what their relations before that had been and
of what their future relations might be if mr coldfield had believed s ut pen guilty at the time of any crime he would not
have raised a finger to takes u qi a i out he might not have gone out of his way to keeps ut pen in
jail but doubtless the best possible moral fumigation which s ut pen could have received at the time in the eyes of his fellow citizens
was the fact that mr coldfield s ned his bond something he would not have done to save his own good name ev mt hoi
h the arrest had been a direct result of the business between himself and s ut pen that afl ir which when it reached a
point where his conscience refused to sanction i the had withdrawn j f iom and lets ut pen take all the profit refusing even to
allows utp a it or dmb urs e him for the loss which in withdrawing he had sufi ered di ough he did permit his
daughter to marry this man of whose actions his conscience did not approve this was the second time he did something hk e that when
they were married there were just ten people in the church in clu dmgt hewed d mg party of the hundred who had been invited
though when they emerged from the church it was at nights ut pen had brought in ahal w ozen of his wild to wait at
the door with burning pine knots the rest of the hundred were there in the persons of boys and youth sandmen from the drovers tavern
on the edge of town stock traders and hostlers and such who had not been invited that was the other half of the reason for
ellens tears it was the aunt who persuaded or cajoled mr coldfield into the big wedding butsu t pen wanted i the wanted not the
anonymous wife and the anonymous children but the two names the stainless wife and the un impe a diable father in law on the license
the patent yes patent with a gold sealand red ribbons too if that had been practicable but not for himself she miss rosa would have
called the gold sealand the ribbons vanity but then so had vanity conceived that house and built it in a strange place and with little
else but his bare hands and further handicapped by the chance and probability of meddling interference arising out of the disapprobation of all communities of
men toward any situation which they do not understand and pride miss rosa had admitted that he was brave par hap s she even allowed
him pride the same pride which wanted such a house which would accept nothing less and drove th rou to get it at whatever cost
and then he lived in it alone on a pallet on the floor for three years until he could fu midi it as it dio
ul dbe furnished not the least of which fb midi re was that wedding license she was quite right it was not just shelter just
anonymous wife and children that he wanted is ta she did not want just wedding but when the female ct is is came when ellen
and the aunt tried to enlist him on die ir side to pen u a de mr coldfield to the big wedding he lef ii
sed to support them he doubtless ran em be md even better than mr coldfield that two months ago he had been in j afl
that public opinionwhich at some moma it during dte five preceding years had swallowed him eventhough he never had t ju it ee veria in
quiet on its st omh had performed one of mankind s natural and violent and in exp lk able volt e foc es and regurgitated
him and it did not help him any that atleast two of the citizens who should have made two of the teeth in the outraged
jaw served instead as props to hold the jaw open and impotent while he walked out of it unharmed ellen and the aunt remembered this
too the aunt did being a woman she was doubtless one of that league of j cf for son women who on the second day
after the town saw him five years ago had agreed never to forgive him for not having any past and who had remained consistent since
the marriage was now a closed incidents he probably looked upon it as the one chance not only to secure her nieces future as his
wife but to justify the action of her brother in getting him out of jail and her own position as having apparently sanctioned and permitted
the wedding which i uic ah ty she could not have prevented it may have been for the sake of that big house and the
position and state which the women realized long before the men did that he not only aimed at but was going to attain or maybe
women are even less complex than that and to the many wedding is better than now ed dir g and a big wedding with a
villain preferable to a small one with a saint so the aunt even used eu ois tears and s utp eo who poco t awy
knew about what was going to happen be cm nio gas the time drew near graver and graver not concerned just watchful like he must
have been from the daywhen he turned his backup on all that he knew the fa css and the customs and he was just fourteen
then he told your grandfather set out into a world which even in theory he knew nothing about and with a fixed goal in his
mind which most men do not setup until the blood begins to slow at thirty or more and then only because the image represents peace
and indolence or atleast a crowning of vanity even then he had that same alertness which he had to wear later day and night without
changing or laying aside like the clothing which he had to sleep in as well as live in and in a country and among a
people whose very language he had to learn that un sleeping care which must have known that it could permit itself but one mistake that
alertness for measuring and weighing event against eventuality circumstance against human nature his own fallible judgment and mortal clay against not only human but natural
for as choosing and discard mg compromising with his dream and his ambition like you must with the horse which you take across country over
timber which you control only through your a bih ty to keep the animal from realizing that actually you cannot that actually it is the
stronger his was the curious position now k few as the solitary onenote hens he not only had the aunt to support her but the
fact that women never plead nor claim loneliness until impenetrable and insurmountable circumstance forces them to give up all hope of attaining the particular bauble
which at the moment they happen to want and not mr coldfield hie had not only public opinion but his own d is in cl
in at ioa for the big wed g to support it without in ex jug rui ty or paradox then the tears won ellen and
the aunt wrote out a hundred invitations s ut penh rout in one of the wilds iio es who carried them from door to door
by hand and even sent out a dozen more pen on alone s for the dress rehearsal when they reached die church for die rehearsal
on die night before die wedding and found die church itself empty and a hand fr il of men from die town spur lieu s
in duding two of old ikh emo tubb es chickasaw s standing indie shadows outside the door the tears came down again bile n went
through die rehearsal but afterward die aunt took her home in a state very near hysteria though by the nest day it had become just
quiet intermittent weeping a in there was some talk even of putting the wedding of fi dont know who it came from perhaps from s
ut pen but i know who vetoed it it was as though die aunt were now bent no longer on merely thrusting sul pen down
the towns dir crat but thrusting the wedding itself she spent all the next day going from house to house the invitation hst in her
hand in a house dress and a shawl and one of the cold fid d they were both women following her perhaps for protection perhaps
just sucked along like a ic in the wake of that grim virago fury of female affront yes she came to our house too though
your grandfather had never intended any th ii else but to attend the wedding the aunt must have had no doubts about father since father
had helped takes ut pen out of jail though die was probably past all ratio dna ti ott by then father and your grandmother were
just married then and mother was a stranger in je fier son and i dont know what she thought except that she would never talk
about what happened about the madwoman whom die had never seen before who came bursting into the house not to invite her to a wedding
but to dare her not to come and then ru died out again mother could not eva a tell what weddings he meant at first
and when fr the r came home he on d mother m hysterics too and even twenty years lat a mother could not tell what
actually happened there nothing comic in it to her father used to tease her about it but even twenty years after that daywhen he would
tease her i have seen her begin to raise her hand perhaps with the thimble on one finger as though to protect herself and the
same look come into her faced i at must have been there when ellens aunt departed the aunt covered the town that morning it did
not take her long and it was complete by nightfall the circumstances of the situation had spread not only beyond the town but beneath it
penetrating the h very stable and the drovers tavern which was to supply the guests who did attend it ellen of course was not aware
of this anymore than the aunt herself was or would have believed what was going to happen evo i if she had been clairvoyant and
could actually have seen the rehearsal of events before time produced them not that the aunt would have considered herself insulated against bo ing thus
affronted she simply could not have believed that her intentions and actions of the day could have any result other than the one for which
she had surrender esl for the time not only all coldfield dni ty but all female modesty as wells ut peni suppose cox il d
have told her but doubtless he knew that the aunt would not have believed him probably he did not even try he just did the
only th ii xg he could do which was to send out tosu t pens hundred and bring in s is or seven more of
his noes men on whom he could depend the only men on whom he could depend and arm them with the lighted pine knots which
they were holding at the door when the carriage came up and the wedding party got out and this is where the tears stopped because
now the street before the church was lined with carriages and bug gf es though only s ut pen and possibly mr cold feel d
remarked that instead of hd ng drawn up before the door and empty tli ey wore li al ted across the sfx eet and s
du occupied and that now the banquet te before the church door was a sort of a rau lighted by the smoking torches which the
hdd above ih dr heads the light of which wavered and gleamed upon the two lines of faces between which the party would have to
pass to alter the church there were no catcalls yet no j ring evidently neither ellen nor the aunt suspected that anything was w roi
for a time ellen walked out of the we qi ing the tears and so into the church it was empty yet save for your
grand fet her and grandmother and perhaps a half dozen more who might have come out of loyalty to the goldfields or perhaps to be
dose and so miss nothing of that which the town as represented by the waiting carriages seemed to have anticipated as well as s utp
eu did it was st f ll empty even after the ceremony started and con dude de hen had something of pride too or atleast
that vanity which at times can assume the office of pride and fortitude besides nothing had happened yet the crowd outside was quiet yet perhaps
out of respect for the church out of that aptitude and eagerness of the a no saxon for complete mystical acceptance of immolated sti dc
sandstones she seems to have walked out of the church and so into it without any warning whatever perhaps she was s tie moving baie
a th that pride which would not allow die people inside the church to see her weeps he just walked into it probably hurrying toward
these du sion of the carriage where she could weep perhaps her first in tim at i ott was th evoked i outing lookout don
thither now land then the object c fe filth whatever it was pacing ha car perhaps the changing ht itself as she turned and saw
co ie of the his torch raised and in the art of rh j ng toward the crowd the faces when s utp enke him
m that tongue which even now a good part of the county did not know was a civilized language tli at was what she saw
what the others saw from the halted carriages across the street the bride shrinking into the shelter of his armas he drew her behind him
and he standing there not moving even after another object they threw nothing w hid h could actually injure it was only clods of dirt
and vegetable refuses truck the hat from his head and a third struck him full in the chest standing there motionless with an expression almost
of smiling where his teeth showed through the beard holding his wild with that one word there were doubtless pistols in the crowd certainly knives
the would not have lived ten seconds if he had sprung while about the wedding party the circle of faces with open mouths and torch
reflecting eyes seemed to advance and waver and shift and vanish in the smoky glare of the burning pine he retreated to the carriage shielding
the two women with his body ordering the to follow with another word but they threw nothing else appa rend y it was that first
spontaneous outburst though they had come armed and prepared with the ones they did throw in act that seemed to j ve been the entire
business wh idi had come to ahead when the vigilance committee followed him to mr cold fid ds gate that day two months be fi
are because the men who had composed the mob the traders and drovers and teamsters returned vanished back into the region from which they had
emerged for this one occasion like rats scattered departed about the country feces which even ellen was not to remember seen for the night or
the meal or just tite drink at other taverns twenty and fifty and a hundred miles fi irt her on a lob nameless roads and
then gone from there too and those who had come in the cart k and buggies to see a homan holiday driving out tosu t
pms ihm dred to call and the mm to hunt his gmt e an death is frio d again and ono oca a on gathering
at night in his stable while he matched two of his wild k against one another as men match gamecocks or perhaps even entered the
ring him see it blew away though not out of memory he did not forget that night eventhough eu eni think did since she washed
it out of her remembering with tears yes she was weeping again now it did in d drain on that marriage iii if he threw
miss rosa over i wouldnt think she would want to tell anybody about it quentin said ah mr comp son said again after mr coldfield
died in miss rosa moved out tosu t pens hundred to h ve with judith she was twenty the nom years younger than her niece
whom in obedience to her sisters dying requests he set out to save from the family s doom which s ut pen seemed benton accomplishing
apparently by the process of marrying him she miss rosa was bom in with her sister already seven years married and the mother of two
du ld ren and miss rosa bom into her parents middle age her mother must have been atleast forty and she died in that child
bed and miss rosa never forgave her fr the r for it and at a time w hm granted that miss rosa merely mirrored her
parents attitude toward the son in law the family wanted only peace and quiet and probably did note jsp ect and maybe did not even
want another hil d but she was bom at the price of her mothers life and was never to be permitted to forget it she
was raised by the same spinster aunt who tried toft rce not only the elder sisters bridegroom but the wedding too down the throat of
a town which did not want it growing up in that dosed masonry of females to see in the fact of her own bre i
thing not only el one justification for the sacrifice of her mothers life not only a living and walking reproach to her father but a
breathing indictment ubiquitous and even transferable of the entire male principle that principle which had left the aunt a virgin at thirty five so for
the first sixteen years of her life she lived in that grim tight lit de house with the father whom she hated without knowing it
that queer silent man whose only companion and f ii end seems to have been his conscience and the only thing he m red about
his reputation for probity among his fellow men that man who was later to nail himself in his attic and starve to death rather than
lookup on his native land in the throes of repel lm gan invading army and d he aunt who even ten years later was still
taking revenge for the fiasco of ellens wedding by striking at the town the human race through any arid all of its creatures brother nieces
nephew in law her s df and all with the blind irrational fury of a shedding snake the aunt had taught miss rosa to lookup
on her sister as a woman who had vanished not only out of the family and the house but out of life too into an
edifice like bluebeard s and there trans mo gri fie d into a mask look ir back with passive and hopeless grief upon the irrevocable
world held there not in durance but in a kind of jeering suspension by a man who had entered her s and her family s
life before she was bom with the abruptness of a tornado done irrevocable and incalculable damage and gone on in a grim mausoleum air of
puritan righteousness and out ned female vindictiveness miss rosa s childhood was passed that aged and ancient and timeless absence of youth which consisted of
a cassandra like listening beyond closed doors of lurking in dim halls filled with that presbyterian ef flu vi um of lugubrious and vindictive anticipation
while she write d for the in fen cy and childhood with which nature had ott i founded and betrayed her to overtake the disapprobation
i rdi any and everything which could penetrate tie walls of that house through the agency of any man particularly her fe tier w lii
db the aunt seems to have invested her with at birth along vr it h the swaddling clothes perhaps she saw in her fathers death
in the resulting necessity upon her as an orphan and a pauper to turn to her next of kin for food and shelter and protection
and this kin the niece whom she had been asked to save perhaps in this she saw fate itself supplying her with the opportunity to
observe ter sisters dying request perhaps she even s a when elf as an instrument of retribution if not in herself an active instrument strong
enough to cope with him atleast as a kind of passive symbol of inescapable reminding to rise bloodless and w ifil out dimension from the
sacrificial stone of the marriage bed because until he came back from virginia in and found her living there with judith and c ly ti
eyes c ly tie was his daughter too c lyte m nest ra he named her himself he named them all himself all his own
get and all the get of his wild af rer the country ban to assimilated km miss rosa didnt tell you that two of the
in the wagon that day were women no sir quentin said yes two of them and brought here neither by chance nor oversight he saw
to that who had doubtless seen even further ahead than the two years it actually took him to build b is house and show his
good intentions to his neighbors until they allowed him to mix his wild stock with their tame since the difference in tongue between his and
their s could have been a barrier only for a matter of weeks or perhaps even days he brought the two women deliberately he probably
chc mc them with the same care and shrewdness with which he chose the other livestock the horses and mules and cattle which he bought
later on and he lived out there for almost five years before he had speaking acquaintance with any white woman in the county just as
he had nox fim ii ture in his house and for the same reason he had at the time nothing to exchange for them yeshe
named clyde as he named them all the one before clyde and henry and judith even with that same robust and sardonic temerity naming with
his own mouth his own ironic fecundity of dragons tee tl only i have always hk ed to be he ve that he intended to
name clyde cassandra prompted by some pure drama dc economy not only to be get but to designate the presiding augur of his own disaster
and that he just got the name wrong through a mistake natural in a man who must have almost taught himself to read when he
returned home in miss rosa had not seen him a hundred times in her whole life and what she saw then was just that ogre
face of her childhood seen once and then repeated at intervals and on occasions which she could neither count nor recall like the maskin greek
tragedy interchangeable not only from scene to scene but from actor to actor and behind which the events and occasions took place without chronology or
sequence leaving her actually incapable of saying how many separate times she had seen li im for the reason that waking or sleeping the aunt
had taught her to see nothing else on those guarded and liu b riou s and even formal occasions when she and the aunt went
out tosu t pens hundred to spend the day and the aunt would order her togo and play with her nephew and nie c exactly
as she might have ordered her to play a piece for company on the piano she would not see hn n even at the d
ii mer table because the aunt would have arranged the visit to coincide with his absence and probably miss rosa would have tried to avoid
meeting him even i he had been there and on the four or five occasions during the year when eu en would bring the children
into spend they at her fathers the aunt that strong vindictive consistent woman who seen a to have been twice the man a at mr
col fi eij was and who in very truth was not only miss rosa smother but he rfa die r too cast over these visits
also that same atmosphere of grim embattled conspiracy and alliance against the two adversaries one of whom mr coldfield whether he could have held his
own or not had long since drawn in his pic que ts and d is mande d his artillery and retired into the impregnable citadel
of his passive rectitude and the others ut pen who probably could have engaged and even routed them but who did note vax know that
he was an em bat ded foe because he would not even come to the house to the noon meal his reason may have been
because of some delicacy for his father in law the true reason for and beginning of the relationship between mr coldfield and himself neither aunt
ellen or miss rosa ever knew and s ut pen was to divulge to but one man and that under the pledge of confidence as
long as mr coldfield lived rout of regard for mr coldfield s carefully nurtured name for immaculate morality and which your grandfather said mr coldfield
himself never divulged for the same reason or perhaps the reason was that now since he had got out of his fe the rini a
wall that mr coldfield possessed that s ut pen could have used or wanted he had neither the courage t of ice his fet her
in kw nor the grace and decency to complete the ceremonial family group even four times a year or perhaps it was the reason which
s ut pen gave himself and which the aunt refused to believe because of that very fact that he did not get to town everyday
and when he did he preferred to s paid it e used the bar now with the men who gathered each noon at the holston
house that was the fec e which when miss rosa saw it at all was across his own dining table the face of a foe
who did not even know that it was embattled she was ten now and fil low mg the aunts dereliction miss rosa now kept herb
it her s house as the au at had done until then ht the aunt climbed out the window and vanished there was not only
noone to make her try to play with her nephew and niece on dios e days formal and funereal she did not even have togo
out there and breathe the same air which he breathed and where even thoth absent he s tdl remained lurked in what seemed to her
sardonic and watchful triumphs he went out tosu t pens hundred just once a year now when in their sunday clothes she and her father
drove the twelve miles in a stout battered buggy behind the stout scrubby team to spend the day it was now mr coldfield who insisted
on the visits who had never gone out with them while the aunt was there perhaps from a sense of duty which was the reason
he gave and which in this case even the aunt would have believed perhaps because it was not the true one since dou bd seven
iv diss rosa would not have believed die true one which was that mr coldfield wanted to s his grandchildren regarding whom he was in
a steadily increasing unease of that daywhen their father would tell the son atleast of that old bus i aes s between them which mr
coldfield was not yet sure that his son in law had never told though the aunt was gone she stol managed to bequeath and invoke
upon each of the see a cp editions something of the old flavor of grim sortie more than ever now against a foe who did
not know that he was at war because now that the aunt was gone ellen had reneged from that triumvirate of which miss rosa tried
without realizing it to make two now she was completely alone facing him a a oss died inner table without support even fi rom ellen
at this time ellen went through a complete metamorphosis emerging into her next lust rum with die finality of actual reh rth fo dn gac
rok the table the foe who was not even aware that he s at there not ash ct and brother in law but as the
second party to an an nist ice he probably did not evo i look at her twice as weighed against his own nil y and
children the small s hg ht child whose feet even when she would be grown would never quite reach the floor even from her own
chairs as against who though s mau boned also was what is known as fi ifl bodied and who would have been if her life
had not dec l med into a time when even men found little enough to eat and the end of her days had been without
trouble full bodied indeed not fat just rounded and complete the hair white the eyes still even young even a faint bloom yet on what
would be dewlaps and not cheeks any longer the small plump ringed unsc a rifled hands folded in tranquil anticipation of the food on the
damask before the ha vt land beneath the candelabra and against judith already taller than ellen and henry though not as tall fer sixteen as
judith was for fourteen yet giving promise of someday standing eye to eye with his fet her this fec e which rarely spoke during the
meal with eyes like as you mi put it pieces of coal pressed into soft dough and prim hair of that pom har mouse like

cradle of events time which she had acq m red or cul dva tcd by listening beyond closed doors not to what she heard there
but by becoming supine and receptive incapable of either discrimination or opinion or incredulity list a i ing to the pre fevers temperature of disaster
which makes soothsayers and sometimes makes them right and of the fi it ure catastrophe in which the ogre face of her childhood would appa
rend y vanish so completely that she would agree to marry the late owner of it that may have been the last time she saw
him because they quit going out there mr coldfield quit there had never been any day set for the visit one morning he would merely
appear at breakfast in the decent and heavy black coat in which he had been married and had worn fifty two times each year since
until ellen married and then fifty three times a year after the aunt deserted the mim til he put it on for good the day
he climbed to the attic and nailed the door behind him and threw the hammer out the window and so died in it then after
breakfast miss rosa would retire and reappear in the formidable black or brown silk which the aunt had chosen for her years ago and which
she continued to wear on sundays and occasions even after it was worn out until the daywhen her father decided that the aunt would not
return and permitted miss rosa to use the clothing which the aunt had left in the house the night of her elopement then they would
get into the buggy and depart mr coldfield first docking the two n roes for the noon meal which they would not have to prepare
and so the town b die ved charg mg them for the crude one of leftovers which they would have total thai one year they
did not go do ub des mr coldfield fid k d to come to bred tst is the black cx at and more days passed
and still he did not and that was all perhaps he lt now that die grandchildren were grown that the draft on his conscience had
bear discharged what wi di henry away at the state university at oxford and judith gone even fur die r than that into that transition
stage between childhood and womanhood where she was even more inaccessible to the grandfather of whom die had seen but hide during her life and
probably cared less anyway that state where though still visible young girls appear as though seen di rough glass and where even the voice cannot
reach them where they exist this the hoy den who could and did outrun and out dim band ride and fight both with and beside
her brother in a pearly lamb en ce without shadows and themselves partaking of it in nebulous suspension held strange and unpredictable even their very
shapes fluid and delicate and without substance not in themselves float ii and seeking but merely waiting parasitic and potent and sera ie drawing to
the mse lvs without e fib rt die post goi it ive upon and about which to shape flow into back breast bosom flank thigh
now the period began which ended in the catastrophe which caused a reversal so complete in miss rosa as to permit her to agree to
marry the man whom she had grownup to lookup on as an ogre it was not a volt e face of character that did not
change even her behavior did not change to any extent even if charles bon had not died she would in all probability have gone out
tosu t pens hundred to live a fier her fathers death sooner or later and once she had done so she would have probably passed
the remainder of her life there but if bon had lived and he and judith had married and he my had re nui ned in
the known world she would have moved out there only when she was ready to and she would have lived in her dead sisters fiu
nil y only as the aunt which she act ii ally was it was not her character that changed despite the six years or so
since she had actually seen him and certainly the four years which she had spent feeding herb lt her secretly at night while he hid
from confederate provost marshals in the attic at the sametime she was writing heroic poetry about the very men from whom her father was hiding
and who would have shot him or hung him without trial if they had found him and incidentally the ogre of her childhood was one
of them and he brought home with him a citation for valor in lees own hand a good one the face which miss rosa carried
out there to live for the rest of her life was the same face which had watched him across the dinner table and which he
likewise could not have said how many time she had seen nor when and where not for the reason that he was unable to forget
it but because he could probably not have remembered it enough to have described it ten minutes after looking away and from behind the face
the same woman who had been that child now watched him with that same grim and cold intensity although she was not to sees ut
pen again fr rye an she now saw her sister and niece more often than ever ellen was now at the full peak of what
the aunt would have called her renegade ry she seemed not only to acquiesce to be reconciled to he rh fe and marriage but to
be actually proud of it is he had bloomed as if fate were crowding the normal indian summer which should have bloomed gradually and faded
grace fi illy through six or eight years into three or four either for compensation for what was to come or to dear the books
pay the check to which fates wife nature had signed his name ellen was in her late thirties plump her face un blemished still it
was as though whatever marks bdb g in the world had left upon it up to the time the aunt van id t had been
removed from between the skeleton and the s km between the sum of eerie n ce and the envelope in which it resides by the
intervening years of anneal ii and untroubled flesh her carriage air now was a little regal she and judith made fire que nt trips to
town now calling upon the same ladies some of whom were now grandmothers whom the aunt had tried to force to attend the wedding twenty
years ago and to the meager possibilities which the town offered shopping as though she had succeeded at last in evacuating not only the puritan
heritage but reality itself had immolated outrageous husband and incomprehensible children into shades escaped at last into a world of pure illusion in which safe
from any harm she moved lived from attitude to attitude against her background of chat elaine to the largest wife to the wealthiest mother of
the most fortunate when she shopped there ware twenty stores in jefferson now die unbent without even getting out of the carriage gracious and assured
and talking the most complete nonsense speaking her bright set meaningless phrases out of the part which she had wi it to i for herself
of the duchess peripatetic with property soups and me didn cs among a soil less and unco mpd led peasantry a woman who if she
had had the fort it u to bear sorrow and trouble might have risen to actual stardom in the role of the matriarch arbitrating from
the fireside comer of a crone the pride and destiny of her family instead of turning at the last to the youngest member of it
and asking her to protect the others often twice and sometimes three times a week the two of th pm came to town and into
the house die foolish unreal voluble preserved wo ip an now six years absent f tom the world die woman who had quitted home and
kin on a flood of tears and in a shadowy mi as mi creon something like the bitter pur lieu s of styx had produced
two children and then rose e the swamp hatched butterfly un impeded by weight of stomach and all the heavy organs of suffering and ex
pen en ce into a perennial bright vacuum of arrested sun and judith the young girl dreaming not living in her complete detachment and impervious
ness to actuality almost like physical deaf ii ess to them miss rosa must not have been anything at all now not the child who
had been the object and victim of the vanished aunts vindictive unflagging care and attention and not even the woman which her office as housekeeper
would indicate and certainly not the factual aunt herself and it would be hard to say which of the two sister or niece was the
most unreal to miss rosa in turn the adult who had escaped re ah ty into a bland region people d by dolls or the
young girl who slept waking in some suspension so completely physical as to resemble the state before birth and as far removed from re ah
ty s other extreme as ellen was ff om her s driving up to the house twice and three times a week and one time
in the summer when judith was seventeen stopping mon their way overland to memphis to buy judith clothes yes a trousseau that was the summer
following henry s first year at the university after he had brought charles bon home with him for christmas and then again to spend a
week or so of die summer vacation before bon rode on to the river to take the steamboat home to new orleans the summer in
which s ut pen himself went away on business ellen said doubtless unaware such was her existence then that she did not know where her
husband had gone and not even conscious that she was not curious noone but your grandfather and perhaps clyde was ever to know that s
ut pen had gone to new orleans too they would enter miss rosa s house that dim grim fh t little house where even yet
four years af fer die had left the aunt still seemed to be just beyond any door with her hand already on die knob and
w the ll m would fill with tenor fifteen minutes of shrill uproar and then depart taking with her the dreamy and vo i it
ion less daughter who had not spoken one word and miss rosa who in actual fact was the gt cls aunt and who by actual
years should have been her sister ignoring the mother to follow the departing and inaccessible daughter with myopic and inarticulate yearning and not one whit
of jealousy projecting upon judith all the abortive dreams and delusions of her own doomed and frustrated youth offering judith the only gift it was
ellen who told this with shrieks of amusement more dian once in her power she offered to teach judith how to keep house and plan
meals and count laundry receiving for die o ser the blank fathomless stare the unh caring what j what did you say while even now
ellen was shrieking with astonished appreciation then they were gone carriage bundles ellens peacock amusement the nieces impenetrable dreaming when they came to town next
and the carriage stopped before mr coldfield s house one of then egresses came out and said that miss rosa was not at home that
summer she saw henry again too she had not seen him since die summer before although he had been home christmas with charles bon his
friend fi rom the university and she had heard about the balls and parties at s ut pens hundred during the holidays but she and
her father had not gone out and when hau y stopped with bon on the way back to sdio ol the day after new years
to speak to his aunt she actually was not at home so she did not see him until the fo howie summer after a full
years he was downtown shop pi is he was standing on the street talking to your grandmother when he rode pas the didnt see her
he passed on a new mare which his father had vo i him in the coat and hat of a man now your grandmother said
hc was as tall as his f other and that he satti nm are with the same sw aer altho ih lighter in the bone
than s ut pen as if his bones were capable of bearing the swagger but were still too light and quick to support the pomposity
because s ut pen was acting role too he had corrupted ellen in more ways than one he was the biggest single landowner and cotton
planter in the county now attained by the same tactics with which he had built his house the same single minded unflagging effort and utter
disregard of how his actions which the town could see might look and how the ones which the town could not see must appear to
it there were some among his fellow citizens who believed even yet that there was a in the woodpile somewhere ranging ff om the ones
who believed that the plantation was just a blind to his actual dark avocation through the ones who believed that he had f is und
some way to juggle the cotton market itself and so get more per bale for his cotton than honest men could to those who believed
apparently that the wild which he had bro i ht there had the power to actually conjure more cotton per acre from the soil than
any tame ones had ever done he was not hk ed which he evi den dy did not want anyway but feared which seemed to
amuse if not actually please him but he was accepted he obviously had too much money now to be rejected or even seriously annoyed anymore
he accomplished this go this plantation to run nii smoothly he had an overseer now it was the son of that same sheriff who had
arrested him a this bride to be s gate on the day of the betrothal within ten years of the wedding and now he acted
his role to oz role of arrogant ease and leisure which as the leisure and ease put flesh on him became al it de pompous
yeshe had corrupted ellen to more than re nia de ry though like her hey sr as unaware that his flow rain g was a
forced blooming too and that while he st ifl playing the scene to the audience behind him bate des d ny retribution irony tie stage
manager call him what you will was already striking the set and dragging on die synthetic and spurious shadows and shapes of the next one
there goes your grandmother said but miss rosa had already seen henry she was standing there beside your grandmother her head hardly reading your grand
m of i ers shoulder thin in one of the dresses which the aunt had left in the house and which miss rosa had cut
down to fit herself who had never been taught to sew either just as she had assumed the housekeeping and offered to teach judith tod
of he same v dio had never been taught to cook nor taught to do anything save lister through closed doors standing there with a
shawl over her head like she might have been fifty instead of fifteen looking after her nephew and saying why he s slaved then she
stopped seeing ellen even that is ellen also stopped coming to the house stopped breaking the carries weekly ritual of store to store where without
getting out ellen bade merchant and de rk fetch out to her the cloth and the meager f ii ppe ries and baubles which they
carried and which they knew ev m better than she that sik would not buy but instead would merely finger and handle and disarrange and
then reject all in that flow of brit pet tish volubility not contemptuous not even patronizing exactly but with a bland and even childlike imposition
upon the sufi er ance or good manners or sheer hd plc s s ness of the men the merchants and der ks then to
come to die house and fill it too with that meaning uproar of vanity of imp os able and f bund a don less advice
about miss rosa and her the rand the house about miss rosa s do thc s and the arrangement of the furniture and how the
food was prepared and even the hours at which it was eaten because the time now appr t ached it was i even mr coldfield
probably admit tcd that war was unavoidable when the destiny of s ut pens fei m ly which for twenty years now had been like
a lake welling from quiet springs into a quiet valley and spreading rising almost imperceptibly and in which the four members of it floated in
sunny suspension felt the first subterranean movement toward ti he outlet the gorge w li ich would be the lands catastrophe too and the four
peaceful swimmers turning suddenly to face one another not yet with alarm or distrust but just alert feeling the dark set none of them yet
at that point where man looks about a this companions in disaster and thinks when will is top trying to save them and save only
my sel p and not even aware that that point was approaching so miss rosa did not see any of them she had never seen
and was never to sec alive charles bona tall charles bon of new orleans henry s friend who was not only some few years older
than henry but actually a little old to be still in college and certainly a little out of place in hat one where he was
a small new college in the mississippi hinterland and even wilderness three hundred miles from that worldly and even foreign city which was his home
z young man of a worldly elegance and assurance beyond his years handsome apparently wealthy and with for background the shadowy figure of a legal
guardian rather than any parents a personage who in the remote mississippi of that time must have appeared almost ph oen bt like fb ll
sp rui from no childhood bom of no woman and impervious to time and vanished leaving no bones nor dust anywhere iman with an ease
of manner and a swaggering gallant air in comparison with which s ut pens pompous arrogance was clumsy bluff and henry a ett ya hobble
de hoy miss rosa never saw him this was a picture animage it was not what ellen told her ellen at the absolute halcyon of
her butterfly s sumi ik x and now w if ili the added dian n of gracious and graceful voluntary surrendering of you di to
her bloods and sex s successor that concurrent attitude and behavior with the engagements span with which mothers who want to can almost make themselves
the brides of their d aught cn wedding listening to ellen a stranger would have almost believed that the marriage which subsequent events would indicate
had not even been mentioned between the young people and the parents had been actually performed ellen did not once ma it ion love between
judith and bon she did not hint around it love with reference to them was just a finished and per fec dy dead subject like
the matter of vi rgb it y would be after the birth of the first grandchild she spoke of bon as if he were three
inanimate objects in one or perhaps one inanimate object for which she and her family would find three concordat uses a garment which judith might
wear as she would a riding habit or a ball gown a piece of furniture which would complement and complete the furnishing of her house
and position and a mentor and example to corre rt henry s provincial mai mers and speech and clothing she seemed to have encompassed time
she postulated the elapsed years during which no honeymoon nor any change had taken place out of which the now five faces looked with a
sort of lifeless and perennial bloom like painted portraits hung in a vacuum each taken at its forewarned peak and smoothed of all thought and
experience the originals of which had eve d and died so long ago that their joys and griefs must now be forgotten even by the
very boar on which they had strutted and postured and laughed and wept this while miss rosa not listen it who had got the picture
fi rom the first word perhaps fi rom the name charles bon the spinster doomed for life at sixteen sitting beneath this bright get t
cr of d du sion like it was one of those colored electric beams in cabarets and she there for the first time in her
life and the beam filled with a subst an cc less glitter of tinsel motes darting suddenly upon her halting for a moment then going
on she wasnt jealous of judit lit was not self pity either sitting there blinking steadily at her sister while ellen talked in one of
those botched over house dresses the clothes castoff sometimes but usually new which ellen gave her from time to time were always silk of course
which the aunt had abandoned when she eloped with the horse and mule trader perhaps in the hope or even the firm intention of never
wearing anything like them again it was probably just peaceful despair and relief at final and complete abnegation now that judith was about to immolate
the frustrations vicarious recompense into the living fairytale it sounded like a fairytale when ellen told it later to your grandmother only it was a
fairytale written for and acted by af as hio iu ble ladies club but to miss rosa it must have been authentic not only plausible
but justified hence the remark which sent ellen again she told this to of or the childish joke it was into shrieks of amused and
fretted astonishment we deserve him miss rosa said deserve hime hen said probably shrieked too of course we derive him if you want to put
it that way i certainly hope and expect you to feel that the goldfields are qualified to reciprocate whatever particularly signal honor marriage with anyone
might confer upon them naturally there is no known rejoinder to this atleast as for as ellen ever told miss rosa did not try to
make one she just saw ellen depart and then set about to make judith the second only gift in her power she possessed two now
one likewise bequeathed to her by the aunt who taught her both to keep house and how to fit do the s by dim bing
out a window one night though this second gift develop tt slate you might say r q per cussed due to the fact that when
the a xm tk ft miss rosa was not yet large enough to be able to use the discarded clothing even by cutting the garments
down she set about secretly mal d ng garments for judith s trousseaus he got the cloth f iom her fathers stores he could not
have got it anywhere else your grandmother told me that at that time miss rosa actually could not count money that she knew the progression
of the coins in theory but that appa ren dys he had never had the actual cash to see touches q peri ment and prove
with that on certain days of the weeks he would go downtown with a basket and shop at certain stores which mr coldfield had already
designated with no coin nor sum of money changing hp or hand and that later in the day mr coldfield would trace her course by
the debits scratched on paper or on walls and counters and pay them so she would have to get the material from him though his
stock which had begun as a collection of the crudest necessities and which apparently could not even fd himself and his daughter from its own
re ives had not increased let alone diversified yet this was where she had tx goto get the material to make those intimate young girl
garments which were to be for her own vicarious bridal and you can im sine too what miss rosa s notion of such garments would
be let alone what her notion of them would look like when she had finished them unassisted nobody know shows he managed to get the
material from her fr the rs store he didnt g we it to her he would have felt it incumbent on him to supply his
granddaughter with clothes if she were in dec x jid y clad or if she were ragged or cold but not to marty in so
i believe she stole it she must have she must have taken it almost from under her fathers nose it was as n tall store
and he was his own de rk and from any poj nt in i the could see any other point with that amoral bou ness
that a ff io ky for brigandage in women but more likely or so i would like to think by some subterfuge of such bald
and desperate trans pa rence concocted by innocence that its very simplicity fooled him so she didnt even see ellen anymore apparently eu en had
now served her purpose completed the bright pointless noon and afternoon of the butterfly s summer and vanished perhaps not out of jefferson but out
of her sisters h fe anyway to be seen but the one time more dying in bedin a darkened room in the house on which
fateful mischance had already laid its hand to the extent of scattering the black foundation on which it had been erected and removing its two
male mainstays husband and son the one into the risk and danger of battle the other apparently into oblivion henry had just vanished she heard
of that too while she was sp oid ii her days and nights she would have to wait until her fe th cr was asleep
sewing tediously and without skill on the garments which she was making for her nieces trousseau and which she had to keep hidden not only
from her father but from the two ness es who might have told mr coldfield whipping lace out of raveled and hoarded string and thread
and sewing it on to garments while news came of lincoln selection and of the fell of sump ter and she scarce listening hearing and
losing the knell and doom of her native land between two tedious and clumsy stitches on a garment which she would never wear and never
remove fira man whom she was not even to see alive henry just vanished she heard just what the town heard that on this next
christmas henry and bon came home again to spend the holidays the handsome and wealthy new orleans ian whose o age ment to the daughter
the mother had been filling e town sears with for six months now they came again and now the town listened for the announcement of
the actual day and then something happened nobody knew what whether something between henry and bono none hand and judith on die other or between
the three young people on one hand and the parents on the other but any wa j when christmas day came henry and bon were
gone and elk n was not visible she seemed to have retired to the darkened room which she was not to quit until she died
two years later and nobody could have told from either s ut pens or judith s faces or actions or behavior and so the tale
came through the of how on the night before christmas there had been a quarrel between not bon and henry or bon and s ut
pen but between the son and the father and that henry had formally abjured his father and renounced his birthright and the roof under which
he had been bom and that he and bon had ridden away in then ht and that the mother was prostrate though the town be
he ved not at the upset of the marriage but at the shock of reality entering her life this the merciful blow of the axe
before the beasts throat is cut that s what miss rosa heard nobody knows what she thor ht the town believed that henry s action
was just the fiery nature of youth let alone as utp a i and that time would cure it do ub de sss ut pens
and ju did is behavior toward one another and toward the town had something to do with this they would be seen together in the
carriage in town now and then as though nothing had occurred between them atleast which certainly would not have been the case if the qu
arr d had been between bon and the father and probably not the case if the trouble had been between henry and his the r
because the town knew that between hairy and judith there had been ard ation ship closer than the traditional loyalty of brother and sister even
a curious relationship something of that fierce impersonal rivalry bot we oi two cadets in a crack regiment who eat from the same dish and
sleep under the same blanket and chance the same destruction and who would risk death for one another not for die others sake but for
the sake of the unbroken front of the regiment itself that s all miss rosa knew she could have known no more about it than
the town knew because the ones who did knows utp a i or judith not ellen who would have been told nothing in the first
place and would have forgot failed to assimilate it if she had been told ellen the butterfly from beneath whom without warning the very sun
buoyed air had been withdrawn leaving her now with the plump hands folded on the coverlet in the darkened room and the eyes above them
probably not even suffering but merely filled with b afl led in comprehension would not have told her anymore than they would have told anyone
in jefferson or anywhere else m sss rosa probably went out die re probably once and then no more and she must have told mr
coldfield tib at there was nothing wrong and evi den dys he believed that herself since she continued tose won the garments for judith s
weddings he was s tie doing that when mississippi seceded and when die first cori fed crate uniforms began to appear in jefferson where colonel
sartori sands ut pen were raising the regiment which departed in i with s ut pen second in command riding at colonel sartori s lefthand
on the black stall ica i named out of scott beneath the regimental colors wh kh he and sartori s had designed and w hid
is art or is womenfolks had sewed together out of s flk dresses he had fill out physically from what he had been not only
wha i he first rode into jefferson that sunday in but from what had been when he and eden married he was not por dy
yet though he was now getting on toward fifi y fi ye the the stomach em ne later it came upon him sudd m lya
eat once m the year after whatever it wash apf ned to his en gag meat to miss rosa and she quitted his roof and
le tamed to town to live alone in he rfa die rs house and did not ever speak to him again except w hms headdress
oi him that one time when they told hertha the was dead the flesh came upon him suddenly as though what the and wash jones
too called the fine figure of a man had reached and held it speak after the foundation had given away and something between the shape
of him that people knew and the uncompromising skeleton of what he actually was had gone fluid and earthbound had been snubbed up and restrained
balloon li kc unstable and lifeless by the envelope which it had betrayed she did not see the regiment depart tc cause her fi it
her forbade her to leave the house until it was gone ref usb g to allow her to take part in or be present with
the other women and girls in the ceremony of its departure though not because his son in law happened to be in i the had
never been an irascible man and before war was actually declared and mississippi seceded his acts and speeches of protest had bear not only calm
but logical and quite sensible but after the die was cas the seemed to change overnight just as his d aug b ter ll m
changed her nature a few years before as soon as troops began to appear in jes crs on he closed his store and kept it
dosed all during the period that soldiers were being mobilized and drilled and later a fier the regiment was gone whenever casual troops w odd
bivouac for the night in pacing refusing to sell any goods for any price to the military and so it was told to the families
not only of soldiers but of menor women who had supported secession and war only in talk opinion he refused to permit his sister to
co nae back home to live while ha horse tid a husband was in the army he would not even allow miss rosa to lookout
the i window at passing soldiers he had closed his store permanently and was at home ail day now he and miss rosa lived in
the back of the house with the front door locked and the front shutters closed and fastened he spent die day the neighbors said behind
one of the sli ghd y opened blinds like a pic qu eton post armed not with a musket but with the big fc mily
bible in which his and his sisters birth and his marriage and ellens birth and marriage and the birth of his two grandchildren and of
miss rosa and his wifes death but not the marriage of the aunt it was miss rosa who entered that along with ellens death on
the daywhen she entered mr coldfield s own and charles bons and even s ut pens had been duly entered in his neat clerks hand
until a detachment of troops would pass whereupon he would open the bible and declaim in a harsh loud voice even above die sound of
the tramping feet the passages of the old violent vindictive mysticism which he had already marked as the actual pic que t would have ranged
his row of cartridges along the windowsill the none morning he learned that his store had been broken into and looted do ub des s
by a company of strange troops bivouacked on the edge of town and doubtless abetted if only vocally by his own fellow citizens that night
he mounted to the attic wi di his hammer and his handful of nails and nailed the door behind him and threw the hammer out
the window he was not a coward he was a man of uncompromising moral st rer gdi coming into a new country with a small
stock of goods and supporting five people out of it in comfort and security atleast he did it by close trading to be sure he
could not have done it save by close trading or dishonesty and as your grand fet her said a man who in a country such
as mississippi was then would restrict dishonesty to the selling of straw hats and ham e strings and salt meat would have been already locked
up by sli is own f emily as a kleptomaniac but he was not a coward eva i though his conscience may have objected as
your grandfather said not so much to the idea of pouring out human blood and life but at the idea of waste of wear ii
out and eating up and shooting away material in any cause whatever now miss rosa s life consisted of keeping life in herself and her
father up to the night when it was looted they had lived out of the stores he would goto the store after dark with a
basket and fetch back enough food to last for a day or two so the stock not renewed for sometime before that was considerably reduced
even before the looting and soon she who had never been taught to do anything practical because the aunt had raised her to be he
ve that she was not only delicate but actually precious was cook mg the food which as time passed became harder and harder to come
by and poorer and poorer in quality and hauling it up to her f if be rat night by means of aw cu pulley and
rope attached to the attic windows he did this for three years feeding in secret and at night and with food which in quantity was
scarcely sufficient for one the man whom she hated and she may not have known before that she hated him and she may not have
known it now even nevertheless the first of the odes to southern soldiers in that portfolio which when your grand fi it her saw it
in contained a thousand or more was dated in the first year of her f others voluntary incarceration and dated attwood ock in the morning
then he died one morning the hand did not come out to draw up the basket the old nails were still in the door and
neighbors helped her break it in with axes and they found hh n who had seen his sole means of support looted by the dp
fonder s of his cause even if he had repudiated it and th fm j with three days uneaten food beside his pallet bed as
if he had spent the three days in a mental balancing of his terrestrial accounts found the result and proved it and then turned upon
his contemporary scene of folly and outrage and injustice the dead and consistent impassivity of a cold and inflexible disapproval now miss rosa was not
only an orphan but a pauper too the store was just a shell the deserted build mg vacated even by rats and containing nothing not
even goodwill since he had irrevocably estranged himself from neighbors town and embattled land all three by his behavior even the two n egresses were
gone now whom he had freed as soon as he came into possession of them through a debt by the way not purchase writing out
their papers of freedom which they could not read and putting the mona weekly wage which he held back in full against the discharge of
their current market value and in return for which they had been among the first jefferson to desert and follow the yankee troops so when
he died he had nothing not only saved but kept do ub des s the only pleasure which he had ever had was not in
the meager spartan hoard which he had accumulated before his path crossed that of his futures on in law not in the money but in
its r resent ation of a balance in whatever spiritual counting house he believed would someday pay his sight drafts on self denial and fortitude
and do ub des s what hurt him most in the whole business with s ut pen was not the loss of the money but
the fact that he had had to sacrifice the hoarding die symbol of the fortitude and abnegation to keep intact the spiritual solvency which he
believed that he had ahead yest a he d and secured it was as if he had had to pay the same note twice because
of some trifling oversight of date of signature so miss rosa was both pauper and orphan with no kin above dust but judith and the
aunt who had been last hear do two years ago while t cy it to pass the yankee lines to reach illinois and so be
near the rock island prison v here her husband who had of ie red his talents for horse and mule getting to the confederate cavalry
remo imt corps and had been caught at it now was ellen was dead two years now the butterfly die moth caught in a gale
and blown against a wall and clinging there beating feebly not with any particular stubborn dinging to life not in particular pain since it was
too light to have struck hard nor even with very much remembrance of the bright vacuum before the gale but just in bewildered and uncomprehending
amazement the bright trivial shell not even changed to any great extent despite the year of bad food since ail of s ut pens had
deserted also to follow the yankee troops away the wild blood which he had brought into the country and tried to blend with the tame
which was already there with the same care and for the same purpose w hid h he bk nde d that of the stallion and
that of his own and with the same success as di ough his presence alone compelled that house to accept and retain human hie as
thoth houses actually possess a sentience a personality and character acquired not so much fi rom die people who breathe or have breathed in them
inherent in the wood and brick or begotten upon the wood and brick by the manor men who conceived and built them in this house
an incontrovertible afl srm ation for emptiness desertion an insurmountable resistance to occupancy save when sancti oi ted and protected by the ruthless and the
strong ellen had lost some fled h of course but it was as the butterfly itself enters dissolution by actually dissolving the area of wing
and body decreasing a little the pattern of the spots draw hal it de closer together but with no wrinkle to show the same smooth
almost girlish face on the pillow though miss rosa now discovered that ellen had been dyeing her hai revid a it ly for years the
same almost plump soft though no wanting im nds on the coverlet and only the bafflement in the dark un comp rd h ending eyes
to indicate anything of present life by which to postulate approaching death as she asked the seventeen year old sister to protect the remaining child
henry up to now was just vanished his birthright voluntarily repudiated he had not yet returned to play his final part in his family s
doom and this your grandfather said spared ellen too not that it would have been the crushing and crowning blow but that it would have
been wasted on her since the ch ng in gmo the vena live would have been incapable now of feeling anymore of wind or violence
so the natural thing would have been for her togo out and live with judith the natural thing for her or any southern woman gende
woman she would not have needed to be asked noone would expect her to wait to be because that s what a southern lady is
not the fact that penniless and with no prospect of ever being otherwise and knowing that all who know her know this yet moving with
a parasol and a private chamberpot and three trunks into your home and into the room where your wife uses the hand embroidered linen she
not only takes command of all the servants who hk e wise know that she will never tip them because they know as well as
the white folks that she will never have anything to tip them with but goes into the kitchen and dispossesses the cook and seasons the
very fix d you are going to eat to suit her own palate it is not this not this that she is depending on to
keep body and soul together it is as though she were living on the actual blood itself like a vampire not within s at i
ability certainly not with voracity but with that serene and idle splendor of flowers abrogating to herself because it fi usher veins also nourishment from
the old blood that crossed uncharted seas and continents and battled wilderness hardships and lurking circumstances and fatalities that s what she would have been
expected to do but she didnt yet judith still had those abandoned acres to draw from let alone clyde to help her keep her company
and wash jones to feed her as wash had fed ellen before she died but miss rosa didnt go out there at once perhaps she
never would have gone iut hoi he u en had asked her to protect judith possibly she felt that judith did not need protection yet
since if even deferred love could have supplied her with the will to exist aid ure for this long then that same love eventhough deferred
must and would preserve bon until the folly of men would stalemate from sheer exhaustion and he would return from wherever he was and bring
henry with him henry victim too of the same folly and mischances he must have seen judith now and then and judith probably urged her
to come out tosu t pens hundred to live but i believe that this is the reasons he did not go event ii ough she
did not know where bon and henry were and judith apparently never thought to tell her because judith knew she may have known for sometime
even eu en may have known or perhaps judith never told her mother at her perhaps ellen did not know before she died that henry
and bon were now privates in the company which their classmates at the university had organized the fi is t intimation miss rosa had had
in four yea is that her nephew was s tula live was the afternoon when wash jones riding sul pens remaining mule stopped in front

waiting in one of the dark airless rooms in the little grim houses impregnable so k tudes he would have no light burning because she
would be out of the house soon and probably some mental descendant or kinsman of him or her who had told her once that light
and moving air carried heat had also told her that the cost of electricity was not in the actual time the light burned but in
the retroactive overcoming of primary inertia when the switch was snapped that that was what showed on the meters he would be wearing already the

for the sake of tins man who was atleast an intending bigamist even if not an out and out blackguard and on whose dead body
four years later judith was to find the photograph of the other woman and a e child so much so that he henry could give
his father the lie about a statement which he must have realized that his father could not and would not have made without foundation and
proof ye the did it henry himself striking the blow with his own hand eventhough he must have known that what his father told him
about the woman and the child was true he must have said to himself must have said when he closed the library door for the
last time behind himself that christmas eve and must have repeated while he and bon rode side by side through their on dark of that
christmas morning away from the house where he had been bom and which he would see but one time more and that with the fresh
blood of the man who now rode beside him on his hands i will believe i willi will even if it is so even if
what my father told me is true and which in spite of myself i cannot keep from knowing is true i will still believe because
what else could he have hoped to find in new orleans if not the truth but who knows why a man though suffering clings above
all the other well members to the armor leg which he knows must come off because he loved bon i can imagine him and s
ut pen in the library that christmas eve the father and the brother percussion and repercussion like a thunderclap and its echo and as dose
together the statement and the giving of the lie the decision instantaneous md irrevocable between father and friend between so henry must have believed th
where honor and love lay and this where blood and profit ran eventhough at the instant of giving the lie he knew that it was
the tm th that was why the four years the probation he must have known that it would be vain even the non that christmas
even otto speak of what he learned saw with his own eyes in new orleans he may even have known bon that well by then
who had not changed until then and so would in all probability not chan later and he henry who could not say to his friend
i did that for love of yot t do this for love of me he couldnt say that you see this man thi youth scarcely
twenty who had turned his backup on all that he knew to cast his lot with the single f ii end whom even as they
rode away that night he must have known as he knew that what his the r had told him was true that he was doomed
and destined to kill he must have known that just as he knew that his hope was vain what hope and what for he could
not have said what hope and dream of change in bon or indie situation what dream that he could someday wake from and find it
had been a dream as in the injured mans fever dream the dear suffering armor legis strong and sound and only the well ones sick
it was henry s probation henry holding all three of them in that durance to which even judi di acquiesced up to a certain points
he did not know what happened indie library that night i dont think she ever suspected until that afternoon four years later when she saw
them again when they brought bons body into the house and she found in his coat the photograph which was not her fec cn other
child he just waked the next morning and die y were gone and only the letter the note remaining the note written by henry since
doubtless he refused to allow bon to write this announcement of the armistice the probation and judith acq u icing up to that point who
would have refill a squid dy to obey any injunction of her father as hairy had be m to le fy him yet who did
obey henry iu this matter not the male relative dte brother but because of that rd bt bn ship between them that hig le personality
with two bodies both of which had been seduced almost simultaneously by a man whom at the time judith had never even seen die and
henry both knowing that she would observe the probation give him henry the benefit of that interval only up to that mutually recognized though unstated
and undefined point and both doubtless aware that when that point was readied she would and with the same calm the same refusal to acceptor
give because of any traditional weakness of sex recall the armistice and face him as a foe not requiring or even wishing that bon be
present to support her doubtless even refusing to allow him to intervene if he were fighting the matter out with henry like a man first
before consenting to revert to the woman the loved the bride and bon henry would have no more told bon what his father had to
u him than he would have returned to his father and told him that bon denied it since to do one he would have to
do the other and he knew that bons denial would be a lie and though he could have borne bons lie himself he could not
have borne for either judith or his father to hear it besides henry would not need to tell bon what had happened bon must have
learned of s ut pens visit to new orleans as soon as he bon reached home that first summer he must have known that su
tj xn now knew his secret if bon until he saws ut pens reaction to it ever looked upon it as a cause fia r
secrecy certainly not as a valid objection to marriage with a white woman a situation in which probably all his contemporaries who could afford it
were likewise involved and which it would no more have occurred to him to mention to his bride or wife or to her f emily
than he would have told them the secrets of afi rate mal organ iz an on which he had joined before he married in fk
t them a imo in which his intended brides fam fly reacted to the discovery of it was doubtless the first and last time when
the s ut pei family ever surprised him he is die curious one tome he came into that isolated puritan country household almost likes ut
pen himself came into jefferson appa rend y complete without background or pastor childhood n man a ht de older than his actual years and
enclosed and surrounded by a sort of scythian glitter who seems to have seduced the country brother and sister without any effort or particular desire
to do so who caused all the p other and uproar yet f iom the moment when he realized that s ut pen was going
to prevent the marriage if he could he bon seems to have withdrawn into a mere spectator passive a little sardonic and completely enigmatic he
seems to hover shadowy almost substance less al it de behind and above all the other straightforward and logical eventhough to him incomprehensible ultimatums and
affirmations and defiance s and challenges and repudiations with an air of sardonic and indolent detachment like that of a youth fid roman consul making
the grand tour of his day among the barbarian hordes which his grandfather conquered benighted in a is caw lii and childish and quite deadly
mud cas de household in ami as mic and spirit ridden forest it was as if he found the whole business not inexplicable of course
just tm ncc ess ary that he knew at once that s ut pen had found out about the mistress and child and he now
found s ut peas action and if cn cy s reaction a fetish ridden moral blunder ir which did not deserve to be called thinking
and which he contemplated with the detached attentiveness of a scientist watching the muscles in an anesthetized fi rog watching contemplating them fix m behind
that barrier of sophistication in comparison with which henry and s ut pen were troglodytes not just the out tide the way he walked and
talk and wore his clothes and handed ellen into died in in groom or into the carriage and perhaps probably ki ed her hand and
which en envied for henry but the man hina self odi at fatalistic and impenetrable imperturbability wit ii which he watched them while he waited
for them to do whatever it would be that they would do as if he had known all the while that the occasion would arise
when he would have to wait and that all he wouldn to do would be to wait had known that he had seduced henry and
judith both too thoroughly to have any fear that he might not marry judith when he wished to not that stupid shrewdness part instinct and
part belief in luck and part muscular habit of the senses and nerves of the gambler waiting to take what he can from what he
sees but a certain reserved and inflexible pessimism stripped long goie rations ago of all the rubbish and claptrap of people yes s ut pen
and henry and the cold se lds too who have not quite yet emerged from barbarism who two thousand year a hence will still be
throwing triumph andy off the yoke of latin culture and intelligence of which they were never in any great permanent danger tobin with because he
loved judith he would have added doubtless after his fashion since as his intended fe the rini aw soon learned this was not the first
time he had played this part pledged what he had pledged to judith let alone the first tune he would have gone through a ceremony
to commemorate it make what distinction he was a catholic of sort shen ugh t be fr veen this one with a white woman and
that odi er because you will see the letter not the first one he ever wrote to her but atleast the first the only one
she ever showed as your grandmother knew then and so we believe now that she is dead the only one which she kept unless of
course a i is s rosa or clyde destroy e the others after f rie herself died and this one here pre r ved not
because judith pin it away to keep but because she brought it herself and gave it to your grandmother af rer bons death possibly on
tie same daywhen she destroyed the others which he had written her provided of course it was she herself who destroy a i them which
would have been when she found in bons coat the picture of the oct oro on mistress and the ut de boy because he was
her fin t and last sweetheart she must have seen him in fact with exactly the same eyes that henry saw him with and it
would be hard to say to which of them he appeared the more splendid to the one with hope eventhough unconscious of making the image
her s through posse sion to the other with the knowledge of the insurmountable barrier which the similarity of gender hopelessly intervened this man whom
henry first saw riding perhaps di rough the grove at the university on one of the two horses which he kept there or perhaps crossing
the campus on foot in the sli ghd y french if i ed doak and hat which he wore or perhaps i like to think
this presented formally to the man reclining in a flowered almost f is mini aed gown in a sunny window in his chambers this man
handsome elegant and ev mc at like and too old to be where he was too old not in years but in ej qp erie
ncc with some tangible ef flu vi um of knowledge surfeit of actions done and s at i at ions plumbed and pleasures exhausted and
even forgotten so that he must have appeared not only to henry but to the entire undergraduate body of that small new pro v in
dal college as a source not of envy because you only envy whom you believe to be but for accident in noway superior to yourself
and what you believe granted a little better luck fh an you have had heretofore you will someday possess not of envy but of despair
that sharp shocking terrible hopeless despair of the young which sometimes takes the form of insult toward and even physical assault upon the human sub
jea of it or in extreme cases like henry s insult toward and assault up t many and all detractors of the subject as witness
if cnr ys wo i ent repudiation of his father and his birthright when s ut pen forbade the marriage yeshe loved bon who seduced
him as surely as he seduced judith the country boy bom and bred who with the five or six others of that small undergraduate body
composed of other planters sons whom bon permitted to become intimate with him who aped his clothing and manner and to the extent which they
were able his very manner of h ving looked upon bon as though he were a hero out of some adolescent arabian nights who had
stumbled upon a talisman or touchstone not to invest him with wisdom or power or wealth but with die ability and opportunity to pass from
the scene of one scarce i mag jb able delight to the next one without interval or pause or satiety and the very fact that
lounging before them in the outlandish and almost feminine garments of his sybaritic privacy he professed satiety only increased the amazement and the bitter and
hopeless outrage henry was the provincial the cl rw n almost given toms tinc ti vc and violent action rather than to thinking who may
have been conscious that his fierce provincials pride in his sisters virginity was als c quantity which must m corporate in itself an in a
bih ty to endure in order to be precious to exist and so must depend upon its loss absence to have existed at all in
feet perhaps this is the pure and perfect incest the brother realizing that the sisters virginity must be destroyed in order to have existed at
all tal d ng that virginity in the person of the brother in law the man whom he would be if he could become metamorphose
into the lover the husband by whom he would be despoiled choose for de spoiler if he could become metamorphose into the sister the mistress
the bride pei hap s that is what went on not in henry s mind but in his so uk because he never though the
fid t and acted immediately he knew loyalty and ted i he knew pride and je al easy he loved grieved and killed still grieving
and i believe still loving bondi e mant owl iom he gave four years of probation four years in tv hi ch to renounce and
dissolve die other marriage knowing that the four years of hoping and waiting would be in vain yes it was henry who seduced judith not
bon as witness the entire queerly pl add course of bons and judith s courtship an engagement if engagement it ever was lasting for a
whole year yet comprising two holiday visits as her brothers guest which bon seems to have spent either in riding and hunting with henry or
as acting as an elegant and indolent esoteric hothouse bloom possessing merely the name of ad ty for origin history and past about which ellen
preened and fluttered out he run vr it ting butterfly sindian summer he the living man was usurped you see there was no time no
interval no niche in the crowded days when he could have courted judith you can note ren imagine him and judith alone together try to
do it and the nearest you can come is a projection of them while the two actual people were do ub des s separate and
dbe where two shade spacing serene and untroubled by flesh in a summer garden the same two ser oie phantoms who seem to watch hover
impartial attentive and quiet above and behind the inexplicable thunderhead of interdiction s and defiance s and repudiations out of which the rock likes ut
pen and the volatile and violent hm ry flashed and glared and ceased henry who up to that time had never even been to memphis
who had never been away from home before that september when he went to the university with his countrified clothes and his saddle horse and
groom the six or seven of them of an age and background only in the surf i ice matter of food and do thing and
daily occupation any different f iom the db ves who supported the mi he same sweat the only di fieri ice being that on the
one hand it went for labor in fields where on the other it went as the price of the spartan and meager pleasures which were
available to them because they did not have to sweat in the fields the hard violent hunting and riding the same pleasures the one gambling
for worn hn ives and brass jewelry and twists of tobacco and buttons and garments because they happened to be easiest and quickest to hand
on the other for the money and horses the guns and watches and for the same reason the same parties the identical music from identical
instruments crude fiddles and guitars now in the big house with candles and silk dresses and champagne now in dirt floored cabins with smoking pine
knots and calico and water sweetened with molasses it was henry because at that time bon had not even seen judith he had probably not
paid enough attention to henryk s inarticulate recounting of his brief and conventional background and history to have remembered that henry had a sister this
indolent man too old to find even companionship among the youths the children with whom he now k ved this man miscast for the time
and knowing it accepting it for a reason obviously good enough to cause him to endure it and apparently too serious or atleast too private
to be divulged to what acquaintances he now possessed this man who later show eddie same indolence almost un interest the same detachment when the
uproar about that engagement which s of aras jefferson knew never formally existed which bon himself never a sir med or denied arose and he
in the background impartial md passive as though k were not himself involved or he acting on behalf of some absent friend but as though
the person involved and interdict were someone whom he had never heard of and cared nothing about there does not even seem to have been
any courtship apparently he paid judith the dubious comp emp nt of not even trying tom in her let alone ma sting on the marriage
either before or after s ut pen forbade it this mind you in a man v ho had already acquired a name for prowess y
mn ng women while at the university long before s ut pen was to find actual proof no engagement no courtship even he and judith
saw one another three times in two years for a total period of seventeen days counting the time which p ll ff ti consumed they
parted without even saying goodbye and yet four years later henry had to kill bon to keep the mfi rom marrying so it must have
been henry who seduced judith not bon seduced her along w nth himself fi omf bard ht ance between oxford and s ut pens hundred
between herself and the man whom she had not even seen yet as though by means of that telepathy with which as children they seemed
at times to anticipate one another s actions as two birds leave a limb at the same instant that rapport not like the conventional delusion
of that between twins but rather such as might exist between two people who regardless of sex or age or heritage of race or tongue
had been marooned at birth on a desert island the island here s ut pens hundred the solitude the shadow of that ft th cr
with whom not only the town but the km others ft mily as well had merely assumed armistice rather than accepting and assimilating you see
there they are this g kl this young country bred g kl who scam an for an average of one hour a day for twelve
days during his lift and that over a period of a year and a half yet is benton marrying him to the extent of for
em gher brother to the last resort of homicide even if not murder to prevent it and that after a period of four years during
which she could not have been alwa certain that he was still alive this father who had seen that man once yet had reas em
to make a six hundred nu le journey to investigate him and d ti her discover what he already and apparently by clairvoyance suspected or
atleast something which served just as well as reason for forbidding the marriage this brother in whose eyes that sisters and daughters honor and happiness
granted that curious and unusual relationship which existed between them should have been more jealous and precious than to the father even yet who must
champion the marriage to the extent of repudiating father and blood and home to become a follower and dependent of the rejected suitor for four
years before killing him apparently for the very identical reason which four years ago he quitted home to champion and this lover who apparently without
volition or desire baa me involved in an engagement which he seems neither to have sought nor avoided who took his dismissal in the same
passive and sardonic spirit yet four years later was apparently so bent upon the marriage to which up to that time he had been completely
in different as to force the brother who had championed it to kill him to prevent it yes granted that even to the unworldly henry
let alone the more travelled father the existence of the eighth part mistress and the sixteenth part negros on granted even the morganatic ceremony a
situation which was as much apart of a wealthy young new orleans ian s social and fo shi on able equipment as his dancing slippers
was reason enough which is drawing honor al it define even for the shadowy para go m which are our ancestors bom in the south
and come to man and womanhood about eighteen sixty or sixty one its just incredible it just does not explain or perhaps that s it
they dont explain and we are not supposed to know we have a few old mouth to mouth talc s we exhume from old trunk
sandboxes and drawers letters without salutation or s nature in which men and women who once lived and breathed are now mer dy initials or
nicknames out of some now in cx imp re liens ib let ion wm ck sound to us like sanskrit or chock ta wwe sec
dimly people ti he people in whose living blood and seed we ourselves lay dormant and waiting in this shadowy attenuation of time possessing now
heroic proportions performing their acts of simple passion and simple violence impervious to time and inexplicable yes judith bon henry s ut pen all of
them they are there yet something is missing they are like a chemical formula exhumed along with die letters from that forgotten chest carefully the
paper old and faded and falling to pieces he writing faded almost indecipherable yet meaningful familiar in shape and sense the name and presence of
volatile and sentient forces you bring them together in the proportions called for but nothing happens you reread tedious and intent poring making sure that
you have foi ott a i nothing made no miscalculation you bring them together a in and a a in nothing happens just the words
the symbols the shapes themselves shadowy inscrutable and serene against that turgid background of a horrible and bloody misc hand ng of human affairs bon
and henry came from the university to spend that first christmas ju it hand ellen and s ut pen saw fahn for the first time
judith the man whom she was to see for an elapsed time of twelve days yet to remember so hat foot years later he never
wrote her during that time henry would not let him it was the probation you see when she received a letter from him saying we
have waited h ng enough she and c ly tie should begin at once to fashion a wedding dress and veil out of rags and
scraps ellen the e sota dc the almost baroque the almost epic ene obj et da it which with childlike voracity she essayed to include
in the fi imi shing and decoration of her houses ut pen the man whom after see i rg once and before ju iy or
gt gem cnt existed anywhere roi save in his wifes mind he s a was a potential threat to the now and at last triumphant
coronation of his old hardships and ambition of which threat he was apparently sure enough to warrant a six hundred mile journey to prove it
this in a man who might have challenged and shot someone whom he disliked or feared but who would not have made even aten mile
journey to investigate him you see you would almost believe that s ut pen strip to new orleans was just sheer chance just a little
more of the illogical machinations of a fatah ty which had chosen that family m preference to any other m the county or the land
exactly as a small boy chooses one anthill to pour boiling water into in preference to any other not even himself knowing why bon and
henry stayed two weeks and rode back to school stopping to see miss rosa but she was not at home they passed the long term
before the summer vacation talking together and rid mg and reading bon was reading law he would be would almost have to smc c only
that could have made his residence bearable regardless of w lia treason he may have brought with him for remaining this the perfect setting for
his dilatory indolence this digging into musty blackstone and coke where of an undergraduate body still numbered in two figures the law school probably consisted
of six others beside henry and himself yeshe corrupted henry to the law also henry changed in midterm while henry aped his clothing and speech
caricatured rather perhaps and bon though he had now seen judith was very likely the same lazy and cath ke manon whom henry foisted now
the role of his sisters intended as during the fall term henry and his companions had foisted upon bon the role of lothar io and
ellen and judith now dropping two and three time sawed k into vm and stopping once to see miss rosa while on their way by
carriage to memphis with a wagon pre ce cling them to fetch hack the ph m and an extra on the box with the coachman
to stop every few miles and build a fire and reheat the bricks on which mens and judith s feet rested shopping buying the trousseau
for that wedding whose formal engagement existed nowhere yet save in ellens mind and s ut pen who had seen bon once and was in
new orleans investigating him when bon next entered the house who knows what he was thinking what waiting for what moment day togo to new
orleans and find what he seems to have known all the while that he would find t there was noone or him to tell talk
to about his fear and suspicion he trusted no mann or woman who had no mans nor womans love since ellen was incapable of love
and judith was too much like him and he must have a en at a glance that bon even thor h the dai h term
ht still be saved from him had already corrupted the son he had be oi too successful you see his was that solitude of contempt
and distrust which success brings to him who gained it because he was strong instead of merely lucky then june came and i he end
of the school year and henry and bon returned tosu t pens hundred bon to spend a day or two before riding on to the
river to take the steamboat home to new orleans where s ut pen had already gc a ie he stayed but two days yet now
if ever was his chance to come to an understanding with judith perhaps event of ill in love with her it was his only chance
his last chance thoth of course neither he nor judith could have known it ances ut pen thoth but two weeks absent from home had
doubtless already found out about the oct en ro on mistress and the child so for the first and last time bon and judith might
have been said to have afi ee field might have been s inc it was really eu en who had the fire e field can
murine her engineering that courtship supplying judith and bon with opportunities for trysts and pledges with a coy and unflagging ubiquity which they must have
tried in vain to evade and escape judith with annoyed yet s tih serene concern bon with that sardonic and surprised distaste which seems to
have been the ordinary manifestation of the impenetrable and shadowy character yes shadowy a myth a phantom something which they engendered and created whole themselves
some ef flu vi um of s ut pen blood and character as though a saman he did not exist at all yet there was
the body which miss rosa saw which judi di buried in the family plot beside her mother and this the fact that even an undefined
and never spoken engagement survived speaking well for the post ul ation that they did love one another since during that two days mere romance
would have perished died of sheer saccharin it y and opportunity then bon rode on to the river and took the boat and now this
who knows perhaps if henry had gone with him that summer instead of waiting until the next bon would not have had to die as
he did if henry had only gone then to new orleans and found out then about the mistress and the child henry who before it
was too late might have reacted to the discovery exactly as s ut pen did as a jealous brother might have been expected to react
since who knows but what it was not the fact of the mistress and child the possible bigamy to which henry gave the lie but
to the fact that it was his father who told him his father who anticipated him the father who is the natural enemy of any
son and son in law of whom the mother is the ally just as after die wedding theft the r will be the ally of
the actual son in law who has for mortal foe the mother of his wife but b fen ry did not go this time he
rode to the river with bon and then returned after a times ut pen returned home to of om where and for what purpose none
were to know until the nc jct chi is tm as and that suni mer passed the last summer the past summer of peace and
content with henry do ub des s without deliberate intent pleading sons suit better than bon than that indolent fatalist had ever bothered top lead
it himself and judith listening with that serenity that impenetrable tr an qi all it y which a year or so before had been the
young girls vague and pointless and dream yun volition but was now already a mature womans a mature woman in love repose that s when
the letters came and henry reading the mah without jealousy with that complete abn egan t transference metamorphosis into the body which was to become
his sisters lover and s ut pen saying nothing yet about what he had learned in new orleans but just waiting unsuspected even by henry
and judith waiting for what nobody ow s perhaps in the hope that when bran learned as he would be obliged to that s ut
pen had discovered his secret he bon wo g realize that the game was up and not even return to school tie next year but
bon did return he and henry met again at the university the letters from henry and bon both now making wey journeys by the hand
of henry s groom and su qa is ti il waiting certainly noone could say for what now incredible that he should wait for christmas
for the crisis to come to him this man of whom it was said that he not only went out to meet his trouble she
sometimes went out and manu fecture d them but this time he waited and it came to him christmas and hie ruy and bon rode
again tosu t pens hundred and even the town convinced now by ellen that the engagement existed that twenty fourth of december i and the
children wi di branches of mis de toe and holly for excuses already lurking about the rear of the b house to shout christmas gift
at the white people the rich ch y t tift ti come to court judith and s ut pen saying nothing even yet not suspected
yet unless possibly by henry who brought the matter to its crisis that same night and ellen at the absolute flood speak of her unreal
and weigh de ssh fe which with the next dawn was to break beneath her and wash her spent amazed and un comprehend mg into
the shuttered room where she died two years later the christmas eve the explosion and none to ever know just why or just what happened
between henry and his father and only the cabin to cabin whispering of to spread the news that henry and bon had ridden away in
the dark and that henry had formally abjured his home and birthright they went to new orleans they rode through the bright cold of that
christmas day to the river and took the steamboat henry st f ll doing the leading the bringing as he always did until the very
last when for the first time during their entire relationship bon led and henry followed henry didnt have togo he had voluntarily made himself a
pauper but he could we gone to his grandfather no he didnt have to gob on was riding beside him trying to find out from
him what had happened bon knew of course what s ut pen had discovered in new orleans but he would need to know just what
just how mud bs ut pen had told henry and henry not telling him doubtless hairy was riding the new mare which he probably knew
he would have to surrender sacrifice too along with all the rest of his life inheritance going fast now and his back rigid and irrevocably
turned upon the house his birthplace and all the mi liar scei e of his childhood and youth which he had repudiated for the sake
of that friend wi di whom despite the sacrifice which he had just made out of love and loyalty he st f ll could not
be per fec dy fi rank because he knew that what s ut pen had told him was true he must have known that at
the very sds tant when he gave his father the lie so he dared not ask bon to deny i the dared not you see
he could fec ep or ert jd is inheritance but he could not have borne that lie from bony e the went to new orleans
he went straight there to the only place the very place where he could not help but prove conclusively the very statement which coming from
his father he had called a he he went there for that purpose he went there to prove it and bon riding beside him trying
to find out what s ut pen had told him bon who for a year and a half now had been watching henry ape his
do thing and speech who for a year and a half now had seen himself as the object of that complete and abn egan t
devotion which only a youth never a woman gives to another youth or a man who fores act lya year now had seen the sister
succumb to that same spell which the brother had already succumbed to and this with novo h tion on the seducers part without so much
as the lifting of a finger as though it actually were the brother who had put the sp eu on sister seduced her to his
own vicarious image which walls ed and breathed with bons body ye there is the letter sent four years a fier w aid written on
a sheet of paper salvaged from a gutted hoi in carolina with stove polish fb t md in some captured yankee stores f iur years
alters he had had any message from him save the messages frome fen ry that he bon was still ah ve so whether e ten
ry now knew about the other woman or nor he would now have to know bon realized dia ti can imagine them as they rode
henry s dh in the fierce re percussive flush of vindicated loyalty and bon the wiser the shrewder even if only from wide res peri
en ce and afr w more years of age lea mii g from henry without henry s being aware of it what s ut pen
had told him because henry would have to know now an did on tb die veit was just to preserve hc my as an ally
for the crias of some future need it vr as because bon not only loved judith after ids fashion but he loved henry too and
i bee eve in a deeper sense than merely after his fashion perhaps in his fatalism he loved henry the better of the two seeing
perhaps in the sister merely the shadow the woman vessel with which to consummate the love whose actual object was the youth this cerebral don
juan who reversing the order had learned to love what he had injured perhaps it was even more than judi dior henry either perhaps the
h fe the existence which die y represented because who knows what picture of peace he might have seen in that monotonous provincial backwater what
alleviation and escape for a parched traveler who had traveled to of arat too young an age in this granite bound and simple country spring
and i can imagine how bon told henry broke it to him i can imagine henry in new orleans who had not yet even been
in memphis whose entire worldly experience consisted of sojourns at other houses plantations almost interchangeable with his own where he followed the same routine which
he did at home the same hunting and cock fighting the same amateur racing of horses on crude homemade tracks hones sound enough in blood
and lineage yet not bred tora and perhaps not even thirty minutes out of the shafts of a trap or perhaps even a carriage the
same square dancing with identical and also interchangeable provincial virgins to music exactly like that at home the same champagne the best doubtless yet crudely
dispensed out of the burlesqued pantomime e lance of butlers who and likewise the drinkers who gulped it down like neat whiskey between flo way
and un sub de toasts would have treated lemonade the same way i can imagine him with iris puritan heritage di at heritage peculiarly anglo
saxon of etc e proud myst id mi and that ability to be ashamed ignorance and in ek pade tin that d ty f brd
gn and paradox ica with los iw di jt no sphere at once fatal and languorous at once feminine and steel hard this grim humorless
yokel out of a granite heritage where even the houses let alone clothing and conduct are built in the image of a jealous and sadistic
jehovah put suddenly down in a place whose denizens had created their all powerful and his supporting hierarchy chorus of beautiful saints and handsome angels
in the image of their houses and personal ornaments and voluptuous lives yes i can imagine how bon led up to it to the shock
the skill the calculation preparing hfc n ry s puritan mind as he would have prepared a cramped and rocky field and planted it and
raised the crop which he wanted it would be the fact of the ceremony regardless of what kind that henry would balk at bon knew
this it would not be die mistress or even the child not even the mistress and even less the child because of that fact since
henry and judith had grownup with a half sister of their own not the mistress to henry certainly not the rug ger mistress to a
youth with henry s background a young man grownup and living in a milieu where the ot i her sex is separated into three sharp
divisions separated two of them by a chasm which could be crossed but ct tie time and in but one dire cd on ladies women
females the virgins whom gende men someday married the courtesans to whom they went while on sabbaticals to the cities the slave girls and women
upon whom that first caste zest ed and to whom in certain cases it do ub des sowed the very fce to fits virginity not
this to henry young strong hooded victim of the hard celibacy of riding and hund rg to heat and make importunate the blood of a
young man to which he and his kind were forced to pass time away with girls of his own class interdict and inaccessible and women
of the second class just as inaccessible because of money and distance and hence only the slave girls the housemaid so eat oia add eased
by white mistresses or perhaps girls with sweating bodies out of the fields themselves and the young man rides up and beckons the watching overseer
and says send me juno or missy lena or chlo ry and then rides on into the trees and dismounts and waits no it would
be the ceremony a ceremony entered into to be sure with a yet still a ceremony this is what bon doubtless thought so i can
imagine him the way he did it the way in which he took the innocent and negative plate of henry s provincial soul and intellect
and exposed it by slow degrees to this esoteric milieu building gradually toward the picture which he desired it to retain accept i can see
him corrupting e fen ry gradually into the pur lieu s of elegance with no foreword no warning the post ul ation to come after
the fact expo ang henry slowly to the surface aspect the architecture al it de curious al it de feminine ly flamboyant and therefore to
hairy o pul o it sensuous sinful the inference of great and easy wealth measured by steamboat loads in place of a tedious inching of
sweating human figures across cotton fields the flash and tter of a myriad carriage wheels in which women enthroned and immobile and passing rapidly across
the vis don pea red like painted portraits beside men in linen a little finer and diamonds al it de brighter and in broadcloth al
it de trimmer and with hats raked al it de more above feces al it de more darkly swaggering dian any henry had ever seat

would fix and then remove without obliterating one line of the picture this background leaving the background the plate prepared innocent again the plate docile

sufi bca ting heart behind it saying i will believe it villi will whether it is true or not i will believe waiting for the

would say again perhaps with words now still watching the sober and thoughtful fi ice but s tiu secure in his knowledge and trust in
that puritan heritage which must show disapproval instead of surprise or even despair and nothing a tau rather than have the di sap pro bad

dream and hope a row of bees like a bazaar off lowe is the supreme apotheosis of chat t dry of human fled i bred

just the key and now the so ed gates closed behind them instead of before no sight or evidence above the high thick walls of
the low city and scarce any sound of it the labyrinthine mass of oleander and jasmine lantana and mimosa walling yet again the strip of
bare earth combed and curried with powdered shell raked and immaculate and only the mostrecent of the brown stains showing now and the voice the
mentor the guide standing aside now to watch the grave provincial face casually and plc a sandy anecdotal the customary way is to stand back
to back the pistol in your right hand and the comer of the other cloak in your left then at the signal you begin to
walk and when you feel the cloak tau ten you turn and fire though there are some now and then when the blood is especially
hot or when it is still peasant blood who prefer knives and one doak they j ce one another inside the same doak you se
each hold ir the others wrist with the lefthand but that was never my way casual chatty you see waiting fir the countryman s slow
question who knew already now before he asked it what would you they be fighting for yes henry would know now or believe that he
knew now anymore he wo idd probably consider anti d imax though it would not be it would be anything but that the final blow
stroke touch the keen surgeon like compounding which the now dio cke d nerves of the patient would not even fed not know that the
first hard shocks were the random and crude because there was that ceremony bon knew that that would be what henry would rer is t
find hard to stomach and retain oh he was shrewd this man whom for weeks now henry was realizing dia the knew less and ls
this stranger immersed and oblivious now in the formal almost ritual preparations for the visit fi nicking almost like a woman over the fit of
the new coat which he would have ordered for henry forced henry to accept for this occasion by means of which the entire impression v
di ich henry was to rard ve from the visit would be established before they even left the house before henry ever saw the woman
and henry the countryman the bewildered with the sub de tide already set dt beneath him toward the point where he must d the r
betray himself and his entire upbringing and thinking or deny the fid i end for whom he had already repudiated home and kin and all
the bewildered the for that time helpless who wanted to believe yet did not see how he could being carried by the friend them a
it or through one of those inscrutable and curiously lifeless doorways like that before which he had seen the horse or the trap and so
into a place which to his puritans provincial mind all of morality was upside down and all of honor perished a place created for and
by voluptuousness the a bas bless and unabashed senses and the country boy with his simple and erstwhile untroubled code in which females were ladies
or whores or slaves looked at the apotheosis of two doomed races presided over by its own victim a woman with a face like a
tragic magnolia the eternal female the eternal who sufi ers the child the boy sleeping in silk and lace to be sure yet complete chattel
of him who begetting him owned him body and soul to sell if he chose like a cal for puppy or sheep and them mt
or watching again perhaps even the gambler now thinking have i won or hd as they emerged and returned to bons rooms for that while
impotent even with talk ri ire wd qc s no longer counting upon that puritan character wh kh must shown either st np ii sen
or despair having to cot n now ii if on anything on the corruption itself the love he could not even say well what do
you say about i the could only wait and that upon the absolutely unpredictable actions of a man who lived by instinct and not reason
until henry should speak but a bought woman a whore and bone veng end y now not whore dont say that in fact never refer
to one of them by that name m new orleans otherwise you maybe forced to purchase that privilege with some of your blood from probably
a thousand men and perhaps still gen dy perhaps now even with something of pity that pessimistic and sardonic cerebral pity of the intelligent for
any human ii yus tice or folly or s ufer ing not whores and not whores because of us the thousand we the thousand the
white men made them created and produced them we even made the laws which declare that one eighth of a specified kind of blood shall
outweighs even eights of another kindi admit that but that same white race would have made them slaves too laborers cooks maybe even fid d
hands if it were not for this thousand these few men like myself without principles or honor either perhaps you will say we cannot perhaps
we do not even want to save all of them perhaps the thousand we save are not one in a thousand but we save that
one god may mark every sparrow but we do not pretend to be god you see perhaps we do not even want to be god
since no man would want but one of these sparrows and perhaps when god looks into one of these establishments like you saw tonight he
would not choose one of us to be god either now that he is old though he must have been young once surely he wr
as young once and surely someone who has csd s ted as long as he has who has looked at as mud i crude and
promiscuous sinning without grace or restraint or decorum as he has had to to contemplate at la steve a though the instance saxe not ns
one in at lio us and thousand the pd ndp les of honor decorum and gentleness applied to perfectly normal human instinct w hid h
you anglo saxons insist upon calling lust and in whose service you revert in sabbaticals to the primordial caverns the fill fi rom what you
call grace fogged and clouded by heaven ddf ying words of extenuation and explanation the return to grace heralded by heaven placating cries of satiated
abasement and fl ella tion in nci die r of which the defiance or the placation can heaven find interest or even after the first
two or fh ree times diversion so perhaps now that god is an old maa i he is not interested in way we serve what
you call lust either perhaps he does not even require of us that we save this one sparrow anymore than we save the one yarrow
which we do save for any commendation from him but we do save that one who but for us would have been sold to any
brute who had the price not sold to him for the night like a white prostitute but body and soul for life to him who
could have used her with more impunity than he would dare to use an animal he if ex or mare and then discard or sold
or even murdered when worn out or v hen her ke qp and hex price no longer balanced yes a sparrow which d himself neglected
to marl because though men white men created her god did not stop it hie planted the seed which brought her to flo war the
white blood to give the shape and pigment of what the whiteman calls female beauty to a female principle which existed queenly and complete in
the hot equatorial groin of the wo idd long before that white one of ours came down from trees and lost ft s hair and
bleached out a principle apt docile and instinct with strange and ancient curious pleasures of the which haq the xe is nothing else which her
white sisters of a mushroom yesterday f tee from in moral and out r sed horror apr m dvd b kh whore her white sister
must needs try to zi make an economic matter of it like someone who insists upon installing a counter or a scales or a safe
in astore or business for a certain percent e of the profits reigns wise supine and all powerful from the sunless and silken bed which
is her throne no not whores not even courtesans creatures taken at childhood culled and chosen and raised more carefully than any white girl any
nun than any blooded mare even by a person who gives them the un sleeping care and attention which no mother ever gives for a
price of course but a price offered and accepted or declined through a system more formal than any that white girls are sold under since
they are more valuable as commodities than white girls raised and trained to fulfill a womans sole end and purpose to love to be beautiful
to divert never to see a mans face hardly until brought to the ball and offered to and chosen by some man who in return
not can and not will but must supply her with the surroundings proper in which to love and be beautiful and divert and who must
usually risk his life ot atleast his blood for that privilege no not whores sometimes i believe that they are the only true chaste women
not to say virgins in america and they remain true and fei th ful to that man not merely until he dies or fire es
them but until they die and where will you find whore or lady either whom you can count on to do that and henry but
you married her you married her and bon it would be a little quicker now sharper now thoth still gentle still patient though stol their
on the steel the gambler not quite yet reduced to his final trump ah that ceremony i see that s it then a formula a
shibboleth meaningless as a childs game performed by someone created by the situation whose need it answered a crone mumbling in a dungeon lighted by
a handful of burning hair some th mgm a tongue which not even the girls themselves understand anymore maybe not even the cx one herself
i rooted in nothing of economics for her or for any possible pro ny since the very fact that we acquiesced suffered the rce was
her proof and assurance of that which the ceremony itself could never enforce vesting no new rights in noone denying to none the old a
ritual as meaningless as di at of collie boys in secret rooms at night even to the same archaic and forgotten symbols you call that
a marriage when the night of a honeymoon and the casual business with a hired prostitute consists of the same sua era in ty over
a temporarily private room the same order of removing the same clothes the same conjunction in a single bed why not call that a marriage
too and henry oh i know i know you give me two and two and you tell me it makes five and it does make
five but the reiss dll the marriage suppose i assume an obligation to a man who cannot speak my language the obligation stated to him
in his own and i agree to it a many the less obligated because i did not happen to know the tongue in which he
accepted mem good faith no the more the more and bon the trump now the voice gentle now have you forgot that this woman this
child are you henry s utp a i of s ut pens hundred in mississippi you talking of marriage a wedding here and henry the
de air now the last bitter cry of irrevocable un defeat yes i know i know that but its still there its not right note
vai you doing it makes it right not even you so that was all it should have been all that afternoon four years late aro
tdd have h app med the next day the four years the interval mere anticlimax an attenuation and prolongation of a cond usi on already
r to happen by the war by a stupid and bloody aberration in the hh and imp ossi bk destiny of the united states maybe
instigated by that family fetal it y which possessed along with all dr cum stance ii that curious lack of economy between cause and effect
which is always a characteristic of fate when reduced to tu ing human beings for tools material anyway henry waited four years holdup the three
of them in that abeyance that durance waiting hoping for bon to renounce the woman and dissolve the marri a which he henry admitted was
non a arr i age and which he must have known as soon as he saw the woman and the cm d that bon would
not renounce in feet as time passed and henry became accustomed to the idea of that ceremony which was still no marriage that may have
been the trouble with henry not the two ceremonies but the two women not the fert that bons intention was to commit bigamy but that
it was appa rend y to make his if cnr ys sister a sort of junior partner in a harem anyway he waited hoped for
four years that spring they returned north into mississippi bull run had b fought and there was a company organizing at the university among the
student body henry and bon joined it probably henry wrote judith where they were and what they intended to do they enlisted together you see
hb iry watching bon and bon permitting himself to be watched the probation the durance the one who dared not let the other out of
his sight not from fear that bon would marry judith with b fen ry not die re to stop it but that bon would marry
judith and then he en ry would have to live ot die rest of his life with the knowledge that he was glad da the
had be m so betrayed with the cowards joy of surrendering without having been vanquished the odi er for that same reason too who could
not have wanted judith without henry since he mustn eye x have doubted but what he could marry judith whan he wi died in spite
of brother and father both because as i said before it was not judith who was theol j ect of sons love or of henry
s solicitude she was just the bl mk shaped be empty vessel in w li ich each of them strove to pre save not the
illusion of him s df nor his illusion of the o th a hut what each conceived the o that o believe him to be
the man and the youth seducer and seduced who had known one another seduced and been seduced vict in ii zed in turn each by
the other conqu a a vanquished by his own strength vanquished conquering by his own weakness before judith came into their joint live seven by
so much as girl name and who knows th a e was the warnow who knows but what the tal it y and the fatality
s victims did not both think hope that the war would settle the matter leave free one of the two it recon dl able s
since it would not be the first time that youth has taken catastrophe as a direct act of providence for the sole purpose of solving
a personal problem which youth itself co not solve and judith how else to explain ha but this ways surely bon could not have corrupted
hato fatalism in twelve days who not only had not tried to corrupt hato unc hast tty but not even to defy ha father no
anything but a fatalist who was the s ut penwith the ruthless s utp encode of taking what it wanted provided it were strong enough
of the two ii ld ren as henry was the coldfield with tlc oldfield cluttering of morality and rules of right and wrong who while
henry sae a med and vomited looked down from the loft that nig lon the spectacle of s utp a i fighting half baked with
one of his half i sake d with the same cold and attentive interest wh h which st n pen would have watched henry fighting
with a boy of his own age and weight because she could not have known the reason for her fi it has objection to the
marri ige henry would not have told ha and she would not have asked h afi it her because evo i if she had known
it it would have made no difference to has he would have acted as s ut pen would have acted with anyone who td bd
to cro lao him she would have taken bon anyway i can imagine her if necessary even murdering the other woman but she certainly would
have made no investigation and then held amoral debate bet veen what she wanted and what she thought was right yet she waited she waited
four years with no word from li im save through henry that he bon was alive it was the probation the durance they all three
accepted it i dont be he ve there was ever any promise between henry and bon demanded or offered but judith who could not have
known what happened nor why have you noticed how so often when we try to reconstruct the causes which lead up to the actions of
men and women how with a sort of astonishment we find ourselves now and then reduced to the be he f the only possible belief
that they stemmed from some of the old virtues the thief who steals not for greed but for love the murderer who kills not out
of lust but pity judith giving implicit trust where she had given love giving implicit love where she had derived breath and pride that true
pride not that false kind which transforms what it does not at the moment understand into scorn and outrage and so vents itself in pique
and lacerations but true pride which can say to itself without abasement i love i will accept no su hst it ute something has happened
between him and my father if my father was right i will never see him again if wrong he will come or send forme if
happy i can bei will if suffer i must i can because she waited she made no effort to do anything else her relations with
her father had not altered one j otto see them together bon might never have even existed the same two cahn impenetrable faces seen together
in the carriage in town during the next few months afterellen took to her bed between that christmas day and the daywhen s ut pen
rode away with his and sartori s regiment they didnt talk tell one another anything you sees ut pen what he had learned about bon
judith that she knew where bon and henry now were they did not need to tall they were too much a like they were as
two pe op k become now and then who seem to know one another so well or are so much a like that the power
the need to communicate by speech atrophies from disuse and comprehending without need of the medium of ear or intellect they no longer understand one
another s actual words so she did not tell him where henry and bon were and he did not discover it until after the university
company departed because bon and henry enrolled and then hid themselves somewhere they must have they must have paused in oxford only long enough to
en roe before riding on because noone who knew them either in oxford or in je fier son knew that they were members of the
company at the time which would have been almost impossible to conceal otherwise because now people fathers and mothers and sisters and kin and sweethearts
of those you i men vre ce coming to oxford from further away than jefferson families with f ii od and bedding and servants to
bivouac among the f emilie s the houses of oxford itself to watch the gallant mimic marching and counter marching of the sons and the
brothers drawn all of them rich and poor aristocrat and redneck by what is probably the most moving mass sight of a e human mass
experience fer more so than the spectacle of so many virgins going to be sacrificed to some heathen principle some priapus the sight of young
men the ht quick bones the bright gallant deluded blood and flesh dressed in a martial glitter of brass and plumes marching away to a
battle and there would be music at night f rd dle and triangle among the blazing candles the blowing of curtain sint afl windows on
the apr fl darkness the swing of crinoline indiscriminate within the circle of plain gray cuf l of the soldier or the band ol gold
crank of an army even if not a war of gentlemen u here private and colonel called each other by their given names not as
one farmer to another across a halted plow in a field or across a counter in astore laden with calico and cheese and strap oil
but as one man to another above the suave pow rd c red shoulders of women above the two raised glasses of s cup pemon
g claret or bought champagne music the nigh dy repetitive last waltz as the days passed and the company waited to move the brave trivial
glitter against a black night not catastrophic but merely background the perennial last scented q ring of youth and judith not there and henry the
romantic not there and bon the fatalist hidden somewhere the watcher and the watched and there current flower la dc a dawns of that april
and may and june filled with bugles entering a hundred windows where a him dred still un bride d widows dreamed virgin un medi tant
upon the locks of black or brown or yellow hair and judith not one of these and five of the company mounted with grooms and
body servants in a forage wagon in their new and un stained gray made a tour of the state with the flag the company s
colors the segments of silk cut and fitted but not sewn from house to house until the swee die art of each man in the
company had taken a few stitches in it and henry and bon not of these either since they did not join the company until after
it departed they must have emerged from whatever place it was that they lurked in emerging as though unnoticed fi rom the roadside brake or
thicket to fell in as the marching company passed the two of them the youth and the man the youth deprived twice now of his
birthright who should have made one among the candles and fiddles the kisses and the desperate tr ars who should have made one of the
color guard itself which toured the state with the un sewn flag and die man who should not have been there at all who was
too old to be there at all both in years and eerie n ce that mental and spiritual orphan whose fate it apparently was to
exist in some limbo halfway between where his corp ore ah ty was and his mentality and moral equipment de sir to bean undergraduate at
the university yet by the sheer accumulation of to of ii u years behind him forced into the extra academic of a law class containing
six members in the war by that same force removed into the isolation of commissioned rank he received a lieutenancy before the company entered its
first engagement even i dont think he wanted it can even imagine him trying to avoid it rr fuse it but there it was he
was orphaned once more by the very situation to which and by which he was doomed the two of them officer and man now but
still watcher and watched waiting for something but not knowing what what act of fate destiny what irrevocable sentence of what judge or arbiter be

authorized advantage of being able to say you go there of atleast sometimes remaining behind the platoon which he directed the private who carried that

because of its very weightlessness nobody to be buried just the shape there colle c lion translated on some peaceful afternoon without bd lor catafalque
into that cedar grove to he in powder light paradox beneath the thousand pounds of marble monument which s utp cn colonels ut pen now
since sartori s had been deposed at the annual election of regimental of ls cer s the year before brought in the regimental forage wagon
from charlton south carolina and set above the faint grassy depression which judith told him was ellens grave and then her grand ft the r
died starved to death nailed up in his own at dc and judith doubtless inviting miss rosa to come out tosu t pens hundred to
h ve and miss rosa declining waiting too apparently upon this letter this first direct word from bonin f tur years and which a week
after she buried bim too beside her mothers tombstones he brought to town herself in the surrey drawn by the mule which both f lie
and c ly tie had learned to catch and harness and gave to your grandmother bringing the letter voluntarily to your grandmother who qu dith
never called on anyone now hadn of ii ends now doubtless knowing no more why she chose your grandmother to give the letter to than
your grandmother knew not thin now but gaunt the s ut pens kuh showing indeed now through the worn the coldfield flesh the h ce
which had long since forgotten how to be young and yet absolutely impenetrable lad absolutely serene no mourning not even grief j and your grandmother
saying me you want me to keep it yes judith said or destroy it as you like read it if you like or dont read
it if you like because you make so little impression you see you get bom and you tty this and you dont know why only
you keep on trying it and you are horn at the same tune with a lot of other people aut wv pd up with them
like trying to having to move your arms and legs with strings only the same strings are hitched to all tl other arms and legs
and the others all trying and they dont know why either except that the strings are all in one another s way like five or
six people all trying to make a rug on the same loom only each one wants to weave his own pattern into the rug and
it cant matter you know that or the ones that setup the loom would have arranged things a little better and yet it mustn utter
because you keep on trying or ha vi r to keep on trying and then all of a sudden its all over and all you
have left is a block of stone with scratches on it provided there was someone to remember to have the marble scratched and setup or
had time to and it rains on it and the sunshine son it and after a while they dont even remember the name and what
the scratches were trying to td land it doesnt matter and so maybe if you could goto someone the stranger the better and give them
something at scrap of paper something anything it not to mean anything in itself and them not even to read it or keep it not
even bother to throw it away or destroy it atleast it would be something just because it would have happened be remembered even if only
from passing from one hand to another one mind to another and it would be atleast a scratch something some th ii that might make
a mad kon something that was once for the reason di at it candie someday while the block of tone cant be is because it
never can become was because it cant ever die or per is band your grand mo tier watching her the impenetrable the aim the absolutely
sera a e face and crying no l no not that think of your and the fa or watching her comprehending still serene not even
bitter o hino not that because somebody will have to take care of clyde and father too soon who will want some th ii to
eat after he com home because it wont last much longer since they have begun to shoot one another now no not that women dont
do di at for love i dont even believe that men do and not now anyway because there wouldnt be any room now for them
togo to wherever it is if it is it would be foil already glutted like a theater an opera house if what you expect to
find is forgetting diversion a it ert a in ment like abed already to of idl if what you want to find is a chance
to lie still and sleep and sleep and sleep mr comp son moved half rising quentin took the letter fi rom him and bene adi
the dim bug fouled globe opened it carefully as though the sheet the desiccated square were not the paper but the intact ash of its
for rn shape and substance and meanwhile mr comp sons v oia speaking on while quentin heard it without listening now you can see why
said that he loved her because there were other letters many of them gallant flowery indolent fire que nt and insincere sent by handover that
forty miles between oxford and jefferson after that first christmas the metropolitan gallants idle and delicately flat to ing and doubtless to him meaningless gesture
to the bu col k maiden and that bucolic maiden with that profound and absolutely in eli cable tranquil patient clairvoyance of women against wh
kh that metropolitan gallants foppish posturing was just the jacka nape antics of a small boy receiving the letters without understanding the mlas not even
keeping them for all tli eir elegant and gallant and tediously contrived turns of form and metaphor until the next one arrived but keeping this
one wm ch must have reached her out of a dear sky after an interval of foi u years considering this one worthy to give
to a stranger to keep or not to keep even toreador not to read as the stranger saw fit to make that scratch tih at
undying mark on the blank face of the oblivion tow hid h we are dl doomed of which die q oke quentin hearing without having
to listen as he read the feint spidery script not like something impressed upon the paper by a once living hand but like a shadow
cast upon it which had resolved on the paper the instant before he looked at it and which might fed e vanish at any instant
while he still read the dead tongue speaking after the four years and then after almost fifty more gentle sardonic whimsical and incurably pessimist k
without date or salutation or s nature you wilt notice how i insult neither of us iy claiming this to be a voice from the
defeated even let alone from the dead hi fact if i were a philosopher i should deduce and derive a curious and apt commentary on
the times and augur of the future f iom this letter which you now hold in your hands a sheet of notepaper with as you
can see the best of french watermarks dated seventy years ago salvaged stolen if you will from the gutted mansion of a ruined aristocrat and
written upon in the best of stove polish manufactured not u vel ve months ago in a new england factory yes stove pe u is
k we captured it a story in itself j mcg in eus an assortment of homogeneous scarecrows i wont say hungry because to a woman
l dy or female either below masons and dix otc s in this year of grace that word would be sheer redundancy like saying di
at we were bree ching and i wont say ragged or even shoe less ance we have been both long enough to have grown accustomed
to it only thank god and this restores my faith not in human nature perhaps hut atleast in mantha the really does not become inured
to hardship and privation it is only the mind the gross omnivorous carrion heavy soul which become inured the body itself thank god never reconciled
from the old soft feel of soap and clean linen and something between the sole of the foot and the earth to distinguish it from
the foot of a beast so say we merely needed ammunition and imagine us the scare a ow s with one of those concocted plans
of scarecrow desperation which not only must but do work for the reason that there is absolutely no room for alternative before manor heaven no
niche on earth or under it for failure to find space either to pause or breathe or be graved and sepulchered and wc the scarecrows
bringing it off with a great deal of elan not to say noise imagine i say the prey and prize the ten plump defenseless sutler
s wagons the scarecrow stumbling out box f fier beautiful box after beautiful box stenciled each with that u and that s which for four
years now has been to us the symbol of the spoils which belong to the vanquished of the loaves and the fishes as was once
the incandescent brow the shining nimbus of the thorny crown and the scarecrows clawing at the boxes with stones and bayonets and even with bare
hands and opening them at last and finding what stove polish gallons and gallons and gallons of the best stove polish not a box of
it a year old yet and doubtless still trying to overtake general sherman with some belated amended field order requiring him to polish the stove
before firing the house how we laughed yes we laughed because i have learned this atleast string these four years that it red ly requires
an empty stomach to laugh with di at only when you are hungry or frightened do you extract some td tima tees sk wee out
of laughing just as the empty stomach extracts dte umm a tees r we out of cd co hol but atleast we have stove polish
we have plenty of it we have too mud i because u does not td te mud t to say w ntt ii have to
say as you am see and so the conclusion and augury which i draw eventhough no philosopher is this we have waited long enough you
will notice how ido not insult you either hy saying i have iv a it ed long enough and the rore since ido not insult
you hy saying that only i have waited i not add expect me because i cannot say when to expect me because what was is
one thing and now it is not because it is dead it died in is i and the rore what is there they have started
firing again which to mention it is red und at icy too like the breathing or the need of ammunition because sometimes i think it
has never stopped it has nt stopped of course i dont mantha time an there has never been anymore of it that there was that
one fusillade four years ago which sounded once and then was arrested mesmerized raised muzzle hy raised muzzle in the frozen attitude of its own
aghast amazement and never repeated and it now only die loud aghast echo jarred by the dropped musket of a weary sentry or by the
fall of the spent body itself out of the air which lies over the land where that fusillade first sounded and where it must remain
yet because no other space under heaven will receive it so that means that it is dawn again and that i must stop stop what
you will say why thinking remembering remark that ido not say hoping to become once more for a period without boundaries or location in time
mindless and irrational companion and inmate of a body which even c fier four years with a sort of d isn ud and incorruptible fidelity
which is incredibly admirable tome is still immersed and obliviously bemused in recollections of old peace and contentment the very names of whose scents and
sounds ido not know that i remember which ignores even the presence and threat of atom armor leg as though through some secretly incurred and
infallible promise and conviction of immortality but to finish i cannot say when to expect me because what is is some hinge lse again because
it was not even alive then and situ x because within this sheet of paper you now hold the best of the old south which
is dead and the words you read were written upon it with the best each box sid d the very best of the new mor
th which has conquered and w kid i therefore whether it likes it or not will have to survive i now believe that you and
i are strangely enough included among those who are doomed to live and di at s all lac comp so nsaids ke received it and
sim and c ly tie made t lie wedding gown and the veil fi rom scraps perhaps scraps into i ded for w li ich
should have gone for lint and did not she didnt know when he would come because he didnt know himself and maybe he told henry
showed henry the letter before he sent it and maybe he did not maybe still just the watching and the waiting the one saying to
henry i have wd ted long enough and e fen ry saying to the other do you renounce then do you renounce and the other
saying ido not renounce for four years now i have given chara e the opportunity to renounce forme but it seems that i cm doomed
to live that she and i boa are doomed to live the defiance and the ultimatum delivered beside a bivouac fire the ultimatum discharged before
the gate to which the two of them must have ridden side by side almost the one calm and un deviating perhaps un resisting evo
if i it a list to the last the other remorseless with implacable and unalterable gti ef and despair it seemed to quentin that he
could actually see them facing one another at the gate inside the gate what was once a park now spread unkempt in shaggy desolation with

me realized that i had come not too late as i had thought but come too soon because it was not henry s face it
was s ut pen face enough but not his s ut pen coffee colored face enough there in the dim light barring the stairs and

that justice whose mol ochs palate paunch makes no distinction between gris de bone and te tider j les h that i would enter the

of limbs is hut a dum sy and belated accompaniment like so many unnecessary instruments played crudely and amateurish ly out of time to the
tune itself in t it at barren hall with its naked stair that carpet gone too rising into the dim upper hallway where an echo
spoke which was not mine but rct i her that of the lost irrevocable might have been which haunts all house sdl enclosed wdl sere

ancient young delusions of pride and hope and ambition ay and love too take judith i said judith there was no answer i had expected
none possibly even then i did not expect judith to an s iver just as a child before the jul l instant of comprehended terror
cd lson the parent whom it act ud ly knows this before the terror destroy sdl judgment whatever is not even there to hear it
i was crying not to someone something hut trying to cry through something through that force that furious yet absolutely roc u ike and immobile
antagonism which had stopped me that presence that familiar coffee colored face that body the bare coffee colored feet motionless on the bare floor the
curve of the stair rising just beyond her no larger than my cunt tv hi ch without moving with no alteration of visual displacement whenever
she did not even remove her gaze from mine for the reason that she was not ho king at me but through me apparently still
muting upon the open doors serene rectangle which i had broken seemed to elongate and project upward something not soul not spirit but some di
it g rather of a profoundly attentive md distracted li tie ning to or for something which i myself codd mm the at and was
net intended ta hear a brooding awareness and acceptance of the inexplicable unseen inherited from an older and a purer race dum mine which a
eat ed postulated and shaped in the empty air between us that which i believed i had come to find nay which i must find
else breathing and standing there i would have denied that i was ever born that bedroom long closed and musty that sheet less bed that
nuptial couch of love and gri fun th the pale and bloody corpse in its patched and weathered gray crimsoning the bare mattress tj te
bowed and un wive d widow kneeling beside it and i my body not stopping yet yes it needed the hand die touch for that
is elf m esme red fool who still believed that what must be would be could not but be else i must deny sanity as
well as breath running hurling myself into that inscrutable coffee colored face the u cold imp lac a hle mindless no not mindless anything but
mindless his own clairvoyant will tempered to a morale vit sun deviating absolute by the black willing blood with which he had crossed it replica
of his own which he had created and decreed to preside upon his absence as you might watch amid distracted nigh i bound bird flutter
into the brazen and fatal lamp waits he said dont you go up there still i did not stop it would require the hand and
is tiu running on accomplishing those last few feet across which we seemed to glare at one another not as two face shut as the
two abstract contradictions which we adua u y were neither of our voices raised as though we spoke to one another fie e of the
limitations and restrictions of speech and hearing what i said dont you go up there rosa that was how she said it dt at quiet
t ke still and again it was as though it had not been she who spoke hut ike house itself that said the words the
house which he had built which some suppuration of himself had created about him as the sweat of his body might have produced some even
if invisible coco our like and complementary s hdl in which ellen had had to u ve and die a stranger in which henry and
judith would have to he victims and pri so tms or die because it was not the name the word the fact i kc as
he had called me rosa as children she had called me that just as she had called them henry and judith i knew that even
now she still called judith and henry too when she spoke of him hy her given name and she might very naturally have called me
rosa still since to everyone else who mi knew i was still a child but it was not that that was not what she meant
at all in fact during that instant while we stood face to face that instant before my still advancing body shou u brush past her
and reach the stairs he did me more grace and respect dw t anyone else i knew i knew that from the instant i had
entered that door to her of all who knew mei was no child rosa i cried tome to my face then she touched me and
then i did stop dead possibly even then my body did not stop since i seemed to be aware of it thrusting blindly still against
the solid yet imponderable weight sik not owner instrument i still say that of that will to bar me f iom the stairs possibly the
sound of the od ter voice the single word spoken f iom the stair head above us had already broken and parted us before it
my body had even pause dido not know i know only that my entire being seemed to run at blind full tib into something monstrous
and immobile wi dia shocking impact too soon and top quick to be mere amazement and outrage at that black arresting and un timorous hand
on my white womans flesh because there is something in the touch of flesh with flesh which d bro gates cuts sharp and straight across
the io us intricate channels of decorous ordering which enemies as well as lovers know because it md kes them both touch and touch of

of the shock which was not yet outrage because it would be tenor soon expecting and receiving no answer because we both knew it was
not to her i spoke take your hand off me i got none we just stood there i motionless in the attitude and action of
running she rigid in that furious immobility the two of us joined by that hand and arm which held us like a fierce rigid umbilical
card twin sister ed to the fell darkness which had produced her as a child i had more than once wto ched her and judith
and even henry scuffling in the rough games which they possibly all di il dr eni do not know played and so i have heard
she and judith even slept together in the same room but with judith in the bed and she on a pallet on the floor ostensibly
but i have heard how on more than once occasion ellen has found them both on the pallet and once in t lte bed together
but not i even as a child i would not even play with the same objects which she and judith played with as though that
warped and spartan solitude w hid ti called my childhood which had taught me and little else to listen bf for ei could comprehend and
to understand before i even heard had also taught me not only to instinctively fear her and what she was but to shun the very
objects which she had touched wet too d there so and then suddenly it was not outage that i waited for out of which i
had instinctively cried it was not terror it was some cumulative overreach of despair itself i remember how as west t tod the rejoined by
that volition less yes it too sentient vio im just as she and i were hand iai ed perhaps not c doud not with words
and not to judith mind perhaps i knew already on the instant i entered the house and saw that face which was at once both
mm and less than s ut pen perhaps i knew even that what i could net would not must not believe i cried and you
too and you too sister sister what didi expect is elf m esme redfoo lex mie twelve miles expecting what henry pe rhcp s to
emerge from some door which knew his touch his hand on die knob the weight of his foot on as ill which knew that weight
and so to find standing in the hall a small plain frightened creature whom neither mann or woman had ever looked at twice whom he
had not seen himself in four years and seldom enough before that but whom he would recognize if only because of the worn brown silk
which had once become his mother and because the creature stood the recalling him by his given name henry to emerge and say why its

not as a woman a girl but rather as the man which i perhaps should have been i was fourteen then fourteen in years if
they could have been called years while in that ut trp as xd corridor which i called childhood which was not living hut rad ter
some projection of the light less womb itself i gestate m dx imp let e not aged just overdue because of some caesarean lade some
cold head nuzzling forceps of the savage time w hid t should have to mme flee iwa it not for light but for that doom
which we add female victory which is ene and then endure wi di out rhyme or reason or hope of reward and then endure ii
dee i heim bfd subterranean fls h that insulate dark who x origin dte fl dino longer remembers which pub es and beats at us
crepuscular and lethargic tenement va th the old un sleeping itch which has no words to speak with other than this was called light that
smell that touch that other something which has bequeathed not even name for sound of bee or bird or flowers scent or light or sun
or love yes not even growing and developing beloved by and loving light but equipped only with that cunning that inverted canker growth of solitude
tv hi ch substitutes the omnivorous and un ration d hearing sense for all the others so that instead of accomplishing the processional and measured
milestones of the childhoods time i lurked un apprehended as though shod with the very damp and velvet silence of the womb i displaced no
air gave off no betraying sound from me closed forbidden door to the next and so acquired all ik ne tv of that light and
space in which people moved and breathed as i that same child might have gained conception of the sun from seeing it through a piece
of smoky glass fourteen four years younger than judith four years later than judit us moment which only virgins know when the entire delicate spirits
bent is me anonymous cu max less epic ene and un ravished nuptial not that widowed and nightly violation by the inescapable and scornful dead
which is theme ed of ti vent y and thirty and forty but a world filled with living marriage like the light and air which
she breathes but it was no summer of a virgins itching discontent no summers caesarean lack which should have to mme dead flesh or even
embryo from the living or else by friction s ravishing of the male furrowed meat j also weapon ed and pano plied a saman instead
of hollow woman it was the summer after that first christmas that henry brought him home the summer following the two days of that june
voc ch tion which he spent at s ut pens hundred before her odeon to the fiver to take the steamboat home that summer after
my aunt left md papa had togo away on business and i was sent out to ellen possibly my father chose ellen as a refuge
far me because at that time thomas s ut pen was also absent to stay so that she could take care of me who had
been bom too late bom into some curious disjoint of my fathers life and if ion his now twice widowed hands i competent enough to
reach a kitchen shelf count spoons and he ma sheet and measure milk into a chum yet good for nothing else yet still too valuable
to he left alone i had never seen him in ever saw him in ever even saw him dead i heard a name is awa
photograph i helped to make a grave and that was all though he had been in my house once that first new years daywhen henry
brought him from nephew duty to speak tome on their way hack to school and i was not at home until then i had not
even heard his name did not know that he existed yet on the daywhen i went out there to stay that summer it was as
though that casual pause at my door had left some seed some minute virulence in this cellar earth of mine quick not for love perhaps
i did not love him how could ii had never even heard his voice had only ellens word for it that there was such a
person and quick not for the spying which you will doubtless call it which during the past six months between that new years and that
june gave substance to that shadow with a name emerging from ellens vain and garrulous folly that shape without even a face yet because i
had not even seen the photograph then reflected in the secret and bemused gaze of a young girl because i who bad learned nothing of
love not even parents love that fond dear constant violation of privacy that st uk if i cation of the burgeoning and incorrigible i which
is theme edm td due of all mammalian meat became not mistress not beloved but more that even love i became all polymath loves androgynous
advocate there must have been some seed he left to cause a childs vacant fairytale to come alive in that garden because i was not
spying when i would follow her i was not spying though you will say was and even if it was spying it was not jealousy
because i did not love him how could i have when i had never seen him and even if i did rw t as women
love as judith loved him or as tie thought she did if it was love and i still say how could it be it was
the way that mothers love when punishing the child she strikes not it but through it strikes the neighbor boy whom it has just whipped
or been iv hipped by caresses not the rewarded child bl it rather the nameless manor woman who gave the palm sweated penny but not
as women love because i asked nothing of hit hy you see and more than that i gave him nothing which is ike sum of
loving why i didnt even miss him i dont know even now if i was ever aware that had seen nothing of his face but
that photograph that shadow that picture in a young gir ys bedroom a picture casual and framed upon a littered dressing table yet bower ed
and dressed or so i thought with all the maiden and invisible lily roses because even before is aw the photograph i could have recognized
nay described the very face but in ever saw it ido not even know of my own knowle ge that ellen ever saw it that
judith ever loved it that henry slew it so who will dispute me when say why didi not invent create it at di know this
if i were god i would invent out of this seething turmoil we call progress something a machine perhaps which would adorn the barren mirror
altars of every plain girl who breathes with such as this which is so little since we want so little this pictured face it would
not even need a skull behind it almost anonymous it would only need vague inference of some walking flesh and blood desired by someone else
even if only in some shadow realm of make believe a picture seen by stealth by creeping my childhood taught me that instead of love
and it stood mein good stead in fact if it had taught me love love could not have stood meso into the deserted midday room
to look at it not to dream since i dwelt in the dream but to renew rehearse the part as the faulty though eager amateur
might steal wing ward in some interim of the visible scene to hear the prompters momentary voice and if jealousy not mans je dous y
the jealousy of the lover not even the lovers self who spies from love who spies to watch taste touch that maiden revery of u
solitude which is the first thinning of that veil we call virginity not to spring out force that shame which is such apart of loves
declaring hut to gloat upon the rich instantaneous bosom already rosy with the fiu shy sleep though shame itself does not yet need to wake
no it was not that i was not spying who would walk those raked and sanded garden paths and think this print was his save
for this obliterating rake that even despite the take it is still there and her s beside it in that slow and mutual rhythm where
in the heart the mind does not need to watch the docile ay the willing feet would think what sus pi ration of the ti
vm ning souls have the murmur o us myriad ears of this secluded vine or shrub listened to what vow what promise what rapt biding
fire has the lilac rain of this wistaria this heavy roses dissolution crowned but best of all better far than this the actual living and
the dreamy flesh itself ohno i was not spying while i dreamed in the lurking harbor age of my own shrub or vine as i
believed she dreamed upon the mok y seat which held invisible imprint of his absent thighs just as the obliterating s and the million finger
nerves of frond and leaf the very sun and moon y constellations which had looked do um at him the c irc um ambient air
held somewhere yet his foot his passing shape his face his spec dd ng voice his name charles bon charles good charles husband soon to
be no not spying not even hiding who was child enough not to need to hide whose presence would have been no violation eventhough he
s at with her yet woman enough to have gone to her entitled to be received perhaps with pleasure gratitude into that maiden shameless confidence
where young girls talk of love yes child enough togo to her and say let me sleep with you woman enough to sayle tus lie
in bed together while you tell me what lov is yet who did not do it because i should have had to say dont talk
me of love but let sue tell you who know already more of love than you will ever know or need then my father returned
and came forme and took me home and i became tain that non desai pt too long add ld yet too short a woman in
the j it uss garments which my aunt had le ji behind keeping a j it less house who was not spying hiding but waiting
watching for no reward no thanks who did not love him in the sense we mean it because there b no love of that sort
without hope who if it were love loved with that sort beyond the compass of glib boo h that love which gives up what it
never had that penny s modicum which is the donors all yet whose infinitesimal we it t adds nothing to the substance of the loved
and yeti gave it aid not to him to her it was as though said to her here take this too you cannot love him
as he should beloved aid dw ugh he will no more feel this giving s weight than he would ever know its lack yet there
may come some moment in your married lives when he will find this atoms particle as you might find a cramped small pallid hidden shoot
in a familiar flowerbed and pause and say where did this come from you need only answer i don th to wand then i went
back home a td stayed five years heard an echoed shot ran up a nightmare flight of stairs and found vy a woman standing calmly
in a gingham dress before a closed door which she would not allow me to enter a woman more strange tome than to any gri
for being so less its partner a woman saying yes rosa calmly into th mid stride of my running w hick i know it now
had begun five years ago since he had been in my house too and had lef in o moret rem than he had ir ft
in j lms where he had been but a shape a shadow not of a man a being but of some esoteric piece of furniture
vase or chair or desk which mien wanted as though his very impression or lack if it on cou field or s ut pen w
cms held pork n to us prophecy of what was to be yes running out of that first year that year he fir re the
war during which mien talked tome of trousseau and it mya us sem of all the dreamy panoply of surrender w hick was my s
mender who had so little to surrender thc tt it was d li had bee cm x there is tk at night ka ve bm
tw hick is die single rod t we ding to above the maelstrom of unbearable reality the four years while i believed she waited as
ii vai ted while the stable world we had been taught to knot v dissolved in fire and smoke until peace and security were gone
and pride and hope and there was if t only maimed honors veterans and love yes there should the remus the love and faith these
left with us by fathers husbands sweethearts brothers who carried the pride and the hope of peace in honors vanguard as they did the flags
there must be these else what do men fight for what else worth dying for yes dying not for honors empty sake nor pride nor
even peace but for that love and faith they if i behind because he was to die ih tow that knew that as both pride
and peace were else how to prove love simm or td it y but not love not faith itself themselves love without hope perhaps faith
with little to be proud with but love and faith atleast above the murdering and the folly to salvage atleast from the humbled indicted dust
something anyway of the old lost enchantment of the heart yes found her standing before that closed door which i was not to enter and
which she herself did not enter again to my knowledge until jones and the other man carried the coffin up the stairs with the photograph
hanging at her side and her face absolutely calm looking at me for a moment and just raising her voice enough to be heard in
the hall below c ly tie miss rosa will he hereford inner you had better get out some more me ed then shall we go
downstairs i will have to speak to mr jones about some planks and nails that was all or rather not all since there is no
all no finish it not the blow we suffer from but the tedious re percussive anticlimax of it dw rubbishy aftermath to clear away from
off the very threshold of despair you see in ever saw him in ever even saw him dead i heard an echo but not the
shot is awa closed door but did not enter it i remember how that afternoon when we carried die coffin from the house jones and
another whiteman which he produced exhumed from somewhere made it of boards tom from the carriage house i remember how while we ate the food
which judith yes j judith the same face cahn cold and tranquil above the stove had cooke date it in the very room which he
lay oxer we could hear them hammering and sawing in the backyard and how is aw judith once in a faded gingham sun hon net
to nmt ch the dress giving them directions about making it i remember how during all that slow and sunny afternoon they hammered and sawed
right under the back parlor window the slow maddening rasp rasp rasp of the saw the flat deliberate hammer blows that seemed as though each
would be the last hut was not repeated and resumed just when the dulled attenuation of the wearied nerves stretched beyond all resiliency relaxed to
silence and then had to scream again until at last i went out there and saw judith in the barn lotina cloud of chickens her
apron cradled about the gathered eggs and asked them why why there why must it be just there and they both stopped long and more
than long enough for jones to turn and spit again and say because hit wouldnt be so fur to tote the box and how before
my very back was turned he one of them added further gut of some amazed and fumbling ratio ci nation of inertia how hit would
be simple ry it to fetch him down and nail the planks around him only maybe miss us judy wouldnt like hit i remember how
as we carried him down the stairs and out to the waiting wagon i tried to take the full weight of the coffin to prove
to myself that he was really in il and x could not tell i was one of his pallbearers yeti could not would not believe
something which i knew could not but be so because in ever saw him you see there are something s which happen to us which
the intelligence and the senses refuse just as the stomachs ot ne times refuses what the palate has accepted but which digestion cannot compass occurrences
which stop us dead as though by some impalpable intervention like a sheet of glass through which we watch all subsequent events transpire as tj
umg hina soundless vacuum and fade vanish are gone leaving us immobile impotent helpless j tx ed until we is i candie that was was
there so tn eih ing of me waik ed in measured cadence with the measured tread of jones and his companion and t fie oph
it usmc cas lm who had heard the news somehow back in town and c ly tie as we bore the awkward and unmanageable box
past the stairs close turning while judith following steadied it from behind and so down and out to the wagon something of me helped to
raise that which it could not have raised alone yet which it still could not believe into the waiting wagon something of me stood beside
the gash year thin the cedars somber gloom and heard the clumsy knell of clods upon the wood and answered no when judith at the
graves mounded end said he was a catholic do any of you all knowhow c cu hol ks and theophilus m cca sun said catholic
be damned he was a soldier and i can pray for any conf e dr it soldier and then cried in his oldman s shrill
harsh loud cacophonous voice yaa a ay forrest yaa a ay john sartori sy aaaaaa yl and something walked with judith and c ly tie
hack across that sunset felda nd answered in some curious serene suspension to the serene quiet voice which talked of plowing corn and cutting winter
wood and in the lamp lit kitchen helped this time to co the meal and helped to eat it too within the room beyond whose
ceiling he no longer lay and went to be dyes took a candle from that fr mun trembling hand and thought she did not even
weep and then in a lamp g loomed mirror saw my own face and thought nor did you either tvi thin that house where he
had sojourned for another br if and this time final space and left not race of him not even tears yes one day he was
not then he was then he was not it was too short too fast too quick six hours of a summer afternoon saw it all
a space too short to leave even the imprint of a body on a mattress and blood can come from anywhere if there was blood
since in ever saw him for all i was fdl owed to imo wwe had no corpse we even had no murderer we did not
even speak of henry that day not one of usi did not say the a un is pr w ter did he look well or
ill i did not say one of the thousand trivial ihi ngs with which the in dom it tale woman hl ood ignores the mans
world in which the blood kinsman show st lte courage or cowardice the folly or it tst or fear for which his fellows praise or
crucify him who came and crashed a door and cried his crime and vanished who for the fact that he was still alive was just
that much more shadowy than the cas traction which we had nailed into a box a shot heard only by its echo a strange gaunt
half wild horse bridled and with empty saddle the saddlebags containing a pistol a worn clean shirt a lump of iron like bread captured by
a man four miles away and two days later while trying to force the crib door in his stable yes more than that he was
absent and he was he returned and he was not three ivo men put something into the earth and covered it and he had never
been now you will ask me why i stayed there i could say ido not know could give ten thousand paltry reasons all untrue end
be believed that i stayed for food who could have combed ditch banks and weed beds made and worked a garden as well at my
own home in town as here not to speak of neighbors friends whose alms i might have accepted since necessity has away of obliterating from
our conduct various delicate scruples regarding honor and pride that i stayed for shelter who had a roof of my own in fee simple now
indeed or that i stayed for company who at home could have had the company of neighbors who were atleast of my own kind who
had known me all my life and even longer in the sense that they thought not only as i thought but as my forbears thought
while here i had for company one woman whom for all she was blood k into mei did not understand and if what my observation
warranted me to believe was true i did not wish to understand and another who was so foreign tome and to dll that i was
that we might have been not only of different races l vh ich we were no to td y of different es which we were
not hut of different species speaking nolan gui ge which the other understood ike very simple words with wh i we were forced to adjust
out m lays to one another being even less infer et u ud of thought or intention than the sounds which a beast and a
bird might make to each other but i dont say any of these i stayed there and waited for thomas sui pen to come home
yes you will say or believe that i waited even then to become engaged to him if is aidi did not you would believe i
lied but j do say did not i waited for him exactly as judith and c ly tie waited for him because now he was
all we had all that gave us any reason for continuing to exist to eat food and sleep and wake and rise again knowing that
he would need usk no iv in gas we did who knew him that he would begin at once to salvage what was left of
s ut pens hundred and restore it not that we would or did need him i had never for one instant thought of marriage never
for one in s tatu imagined that he would look at me see me since he never had you may believe me because is hall
make no bones to say so when the moment comes to tell you when i did think of it no it did not even require
the first day of the life we were to lead together to show us that we did not need him had not the need for
any manso long as wash jones lived or stayed there i who had kept my fathers house and he alive for alm of our years
judith who had done the same out here and c ly tie who could cuta cord of wood or run a furrow better or atleast
quicker than jones himself and this the sad fact one of the saddest that weary tedium which the heart and spirit feel when they no
longer need that to whose need they the spirit and the heart are necessary nowe did not need him not even vicariously who could not
even join him in his furious that almost mad intention which he brought home with him seemed to project radiate ahead of him before he
even dismounted desire to restore the place to what it had been that he had sacrificed pity and gentleness and love and alt the soft
virtues for if he had ever had them to sacrifice feu their lack desired them of others nat even thal neither judith n qr i
wanted that perl taps it was because we did not believe it could hedone but i think it was more th and tat di at
we now existed in an apathy which was almost peta e like that of die blind m sentient earth itself which dreams after no flowed
s stalk norbu d envies not the airy musical solitude of the springing leaves it nourishes so we waited for him we led the busy
event less lives of three nuns in a barren and poverty stricken convent the walls we had were safe impervious enough even if it did
not matter to the wads whether we ate or not and amicably not as two white women and an egress not as three or three
white not even as three women but merely as three creatures who still possessed the need to eat but took no pleasure in it the
need to sleep but from no joy in weariness or regeneration and in whom sex was some forgotten atrophy like the rudimentary gills we call
the tonsils or the still opposable thumbs for old climbing we kept the house what part of it we lived in used we kept the
room which thomas s ut pen would return to not that one which he left a husband but die one to which he should return
as on less widower barren of that posterity which he doubtless must have wanted who had gone to the trouble and expense of getting children
and housing them among imported furniture beneath crystal chandeliers just as we kept henry s room as judith and c ly tie kept it that
is as if he had not run up the stairs that summer cf te moon and dien ran down a gcd n we grew and
tended and harvested with our own hands the food we ate made and worked that garden just as we coo jx dan date tite food
which came out of it wit ii no distinction among the three of us of age or color but just as to who could build
this fire or stir tl ti spot or weed this bed or carry this apron full of com to the mill forme ed with least
cost to the general good in time or expense cf other duties it was as though we were one being inter chai ge cale and
indiscriminate which kept that garden pouting spun di read and wove die cloth we wore hunted and found and rendered die meeker ditch tide herbs
to protea and guarantee what spartan compromise we dared or had th time to make with it t ness h mie d and nagged that
jones into working the com and cutting the wood which was to he our winters warmth and sustenance the three of us three women i
drafted by circumstance at too soon an age into a pinch penny housewife ry which might ham existed just as well upon a lighthouse rock
which had not even taught me how to cultivate abed of flowers let alone a kitchen garden which had taught me to lookup on fuel
and meat as something appearing by its own volition in a wood box or on a pantry shelf judith created by c irc um static
e circumstance a hundred years of careful nurturing perhaps not by blood not even coldfield blood but certainly by the tradition in which thomas s
ut pet is ruthless tv ill had carved a niche to pass through the soft insulated and unscathed cocoon stages bud served prolific queen then
potent and soft handed matriarch of old ages serene and well lived content judith handicapped by what in me was a few year i ignorance
but iv hi chin her was ten generations fir on prohibition who had not learned that first principle of penury which is to scrimp and
save for the sake of scrimping and saving who and abetted by c ly tie would cook twice what we could eat and three times
what we could afford and give it to anyone any stranger in a land already beginning to fill with straggling soldiers who stopped and a
died for it and but not least c ly tie c ly tie not inept anything but inept perverse inscrutable and paradox free yet incapable
of freedom who had never once called herself a dave holding fidelity to none like the indolent and solitary wolf or bear yes wild half
untamed blade half s ut pen blood and if untamed he sy tu my mou s with wild then s ut penis the silent un
sleeping vi dous ness of the tamer slash whose false seeming holds it docile to fears hand but which is not which if this be
fidel hy fidelity only to the prime fixed principle of its own savageness c ly tie who in the very pigmentation of her flesh represented
that de had e which had brought judith and me to what we were and which had made of herc ly tie that which she
declined to be ju as she had dec mm d to he that from which its purpose had he m to emancipate her as though
presiding do of upon the new she deliberately remained to represent to us the threat ful porte ttt of the old we were three strangers
ido not know what c ly tie thought w lt at life site led which the food we raised and cooked in unison the cloth
we spun and wove together nourished and sheltered but i expected that because she and i were open ay honorable enemies but i did not
even know what judith thought and felt we slept in the same room the three of us this for more than to conserve the firewood
which we had to carry in ourselves we did it for safety it was winter soon at tdd ready soldiers were beginning to come hack
the stragglers not all of them tramps ruff i at ts but men who had risked and lost everything suffered beyond endurance and had returned
now to a ruined land not the same men who had marched away but iran formed and this the worst the ultimate degradation to which
war brings the spirit the sod into the likeness of that man who abuses from very despair and pity the beloved wife ot mistress who
in his absence has been raped we were ff raid we fed diem we gave them what and all we had and we would have
assumed their wounds and left them whole again if we amid but we were cf i cud of them we waked and fulfilled the endless

of his father as if hath they and we still lived in that time which that shot those running mad feet had put a period
to and then obliterated as though that afternoon had never been but not once did we mention charles bon there were two a fier noon
s in the late fall when judith was absent returning at supper time serene and calm i did not ask and i did not follow
her yeti knew and ik ne iv that c ly tie knew that she had gone to clear that grave of dead leaves and these
re brown refuse of the cedars that mound vanishing slowly back into the earth beneath which we had buried nothing no there had been no
shot that sound was merely the sharp and find clap to of a door between us and all that was all that might have been
a retroactive severance of the stream of event a forever crystallized instant in imponderable time accomplished by three weak yet indomitable women which preceding the
accomplished fact which we declined refused robbed the brother of the prey r ft the murderer of avid im for his very bullet that was
how we lived for seven months and the none a jie moon in january t lw mass ut pen came home someone looked up where
we were preparing the garden for another years food and saw him riding up the drive and the none evening i became engaged to marry
him it took me just three months do you mind that i dont say he hut i yes i just three months who for twenty
years had looked on him when i did had to too look as an ogre some beast out of a tale to frighten children with
who had seen his own get upon my dead sisters body already begin to destroy one another yet who must come to him like a
whistled dog at that ji rst opportunity that noon when he who had been seeing me for tw etti y years shou u first raise
his head and pause and look at me oh i hold no brief for myself who could and would ay doubtless have already give you
a thousand specious reasons good enough for women rann gj rom womans natural inconsistency to the desire or even hope for posa blew edt k

as judith and c ly tie didi stood there before the rotting portico and watched him ride upon that gaunt and jaded horse on which
he did not seem to s it but rather seemed to project himself ahead like a mirage in some fierce dynamic rigidity of impatience which
the gaunt horse the saddle the boots the leaf colored and threadbare coat with its tarnished and flapping braid containing the sentient though nerveless shell
which seemed to precede him as he dismounted and out of which he said well daughter and stooped and touched his beard to judith s
forehead who had not did not move who stood rigid and still and immobile of face and within which they spoke four sentences four sentences
of simple direct words behind beneath above which i felt that same rapport of communal blood which i had sensed that day while c ly
tie held me from the stairs henry s not no he s no there a hand yes henry killed him and then burst into tears
yes burst who had not wept yet who had brought down the stairs that afternoon and worn ever since that cold calm face which had
stopped mein mid running at that closed door yes burst as if that entire accumulation of seven months were erupting spontaneously from every pore in
one incredible evacuations he not moving not moving a muscle and then vanishing disappearing as instantaneously as if die very fierce and arid aura wh
udi he had enclosed her in were drying the tears faster than they emerged and still standing with his hands on her shoulders and looked
ac ly tie and said a hcl y tie and then at me the same face which i had last seen only a little thinner
the same ruthless eyes the h dr grizzled al it de now and no recognition in the face a tdl until judit it said its
r jos a aunt rosa she lives here now that was dll he rode up the drive and into our lives agm n and lef
in o ripple save those instantaneous and in a edi hle tears bam set she himself was net there not in the house where we
spent our days had not stopped there the shell of him was there using the room which we had kept for him and eating the
food which we produced and prepared as if it could neither feel the softness of the bed nor make distinction between the viands either as
to quality or taste yeshe wasnt there something ate with us we talked to it and it answered i pie st ions its at with
us before the fire at night and rousing without any warning from some profound and bemused complete inertia talked not to us the six ears
the three minds capable of listening hut to the air the waiting grim decaying presence spirit of the house itself talking that which sounded like
the bombast of a madman who a eat es within his very coffin walls his fabulous immeasurable came lots and cari uss s onnes not
absent from the place the arbitrary square of earth which he had named s ut pens hundred not that at all he was absent only
from the room and that because her had to be elsewhere apart of him encompassing each ruined field and fallen fence and c run a
ling wall of cabin or cotton house or crib himself diffused and in solution held by that electric juri o us immobile urgency and awareness
of short time and the need for haste as if he had just drawn breath and looked about and realized that he was old he
was fifty nine and was concerned not afraid concerned not that old age might have if t him impotent to do what he intended to
do but that he might not have time to do it in before he would have to die we were right about what he would
intend to do that he would not even pause for breath before undertaking to restore his house and plante o ionas near as possible to
what it had been we did not imo who whe would go about it nori believe did he he could not have known who came
home with nothing to nothing to four years less than nothing but it did not stop him intimidate him his was that cold alert fury
of the gambler who knows that he may lose anyway but that with a seconds flag ff ing of die fierce constant will he is
sure to and who kes suspense from ever quite crystallizing by she w fierce mani pul dim of the cards or dice until the ducts
and glands of luck begin to flow again he did not pause did not tc ike that day or two to let the bones and
flesh of fl fi y niner ecu peret the day or two in which he might have talked not aboutus and what we had been
doing hut about himself the past four years for dl he ever told us there might not have been any war at all or it
on another planet and no stake of his risked on it no flesh and blood of his to suffer by it that natur d period
during which bitter thou un maimed df feat might have exhausted itself to something like peace like pti etin ike raging and mae du lou
s recounting which enables man to bear with living of that feathers balance between victory and disaster which makes that defeat unbearable which turning against
him yet declined to slay him who still alive yet cannot heart olive with it we hardly ever saw him he would begone from dawn
u tdl dark he and jones and another manor two that he had got from somewhere and paid with something perhaps dte same coin in
which he had paid that ford gn architect cole ry promised mat and at last force that was die winter when we began to learn
what em pet b agger meant and people women lo died doors and windows at night and be gem t of lig hk n each

done before hut now against the ponder able weight of the changed new time itself as though he were trying to dama river with his
bare hands and a shingle and this for the same spurious delusion of reward which had failed failed betrayed and would this time destroy him
once i see the analogy myself now the accelerating dr cles fatal curving course of his ruthless pride his lust for vain magnificence though i
did not then and how could i turned twenty true enough yet still a child still living in that womb like corridor where the world
came not even as living echo but as dead incomprehensible shadow where with the quiet and un alarmed amazement of a child i watched the
mira gy antics of men and women my father my sister thomas s ut pen judith henry charles bon called honor principle marriage love bereavement
death the child who watching him was not a child bute rne of that triumvirate mother woman which we three judith clyde and i made
which fed and clothed and warmed the static shell and so gave vent and scope to the fierce vain illusion and so said at last
my life is worth something eventhough it only shields and guards the antic jury of an insane child and the none eft emo on i
was in the garden with a hoe where the path came up from the stable lot i looked up and saw him looking at me
he had seen me for twenty years but now he was looking at me he stood there in the path looking at mein the middle
of the afternoon that was it th st it should have been in the middle of the r fie moon when he shot m not
have been anywhere near the house at all but miles away and invisible somewhere among his hundred square miles which they had not troubled to
begin to take away from him yet perhaps not even but enlarged magnified encompassing as though in a prolonged and unbroken instant of tremendous effort
embracing and holding intact that ten mile square while he faced from the brink of disaster invincible and unafraid what he must have known would
he the final de feta but instead of that standing there in the path looking at me with something airbus and strange in his face
as if the ham lot the path at the instant when he came insight of me had been a swamp out of which he had
emerged without having been forewarned that he was about to enter light and then went on the face the same face it was not love
ido not say that not gentleness or pity just a sudden over burst of light illumination who had been told that his son had done
murder and vanished and said ah well clyde j he went on to the house but it was not love ido not claim that i
hold no brief for myself ido not excuse it i could have said that he had ned used me why should i rebel now because
he would use me more but i did not s ayiti could say this time ido not know and i would tell the truth because
ido not know he was gone i did not even know that eid m since there is a metabolism of the spirit as well as
of the entrails in wh idi the stored accumulations of longtime burn generate create and break some maidenhead cf the ravening meat ayin a x
cond s time yes lost all the shibboleth erupting of car mot will not never will in one red instants fierce obliteration this was my
in x ant who could have fled then and did not who found th m he had got mon and did not remember when he
had walked away who found my okra bed finished without remembering the completing fu who satu the supper table that night with the familiar dream
doud y shell which we had grown used to he did not look at me again during die medi might have said then to what
deluded sewer gush of dreaming does dw incorrigible flesh betray us but i did not and then before the fire in judith s bedrooms at
as we dr ways did until he came in the door and looked at us and sed df um th you and clyde and ceased
s du entering dms dd no nevermind ross will mt mind if you both hear it too since we are short for time and busy
with what we have of id and came and stopped and put his hand on my head and ido not know what he looked at
while he spoke save that by the sound of his voice it was not at us nor at anything in that room said you may
think i made your sister ellen no very good husband you probably do di ink so bid even if you will not discount the fact
that iam older now i believe i can promise that is hall do no worse atleast for you d that was mya mrt ship that
minutes exchanged look maki td ten garden that hand upon my head in his daughters bedroom a td meade a ee a serene and florid
boast like a sentence ay and delivered in the same attitude not to bespoken and heard but to be read carved in the bland stone
which pediments a forgotten and tame less effigy ido not excuse it i claim no brief no pity who did not answer twi w not
because i was not asked because there was no place no niche no interval for reply because i could have made one i could have
forced th cd niche myself if i had willed to a niche not she wed to fit mild yes but some blind desperate female weep
on s frenzied slash whose very gaping wound had cried not nor and help and save met nono brief no pity who did not even
move who s at beneath that hard oblivious childhood res hand and heard him speak to judith now heard judith s feet saw judi dish
wd not judith that palm in which i read as from a printed d trio nui eli orphaning the hardship the bereave of love the
fl mr hard barren years of scoria tin gloom of axe and hoe and all die other tools de a e ed for men to
use and upon it lying the ring which he gave ellen in the church almost thirty years ago yes anah gy and paradox and madness
too is at there and felt not watched him slip die ring on to my filler in my turn he was sitting now iso in
dw chair which we called clyde s while she stood just beyond die fire lights range beside dx chimney and listened to msv oke as
men must have listened in her own spirits april thirty years ago he talking not about me or hue or marriage not even about himself
and to no sane mortal listening nor out of any sanity hut to the very dark forces of fate tu hie h he had evoked
and dared out of that wild braggart dream where an intact s ut pens hundred which no more had actual being now and would never
have again than it had when ellen first heard it as though in the restoration of that ring to a living finger he had turned
all time bade twenty years and stopped it froze it yes is at tk re and listened to his voice and told myself why he
is mad he will decree this marriage for tonight and pc farm his own ceremony himself both groom and minister pronounce his own i vil
d benediction on it with the very b edward candle in his hand and i mad to of ori will acquiesce succumb abet him and
plunged own d noi hold no brief ask no pity if i was saved that night and i was saved mine was to be some
later colder s a a if ice when wei should be free of all excuse of the surprised importunate traitorous fie shit was no fault
no doing of my own but rather because once he had restored the ring he ceased to look at me save a site had looked
for the twenty years before that afternoon as if he had reached for the moment some interval of sanity such as the mad know just
as the sane have intervals of madness to keep tl tem aware that they are sane it teas more than that even for the e
months now he had seen me daily though he had not looked at me since i merely made one of that triumvirate who received his
gruff unspoken man sgr at it t fort lte spartan ease we supplied not to his comfort perhaps but atleast to the mad dream he
lived in but for the next two months he dtd not even see me perhaps the reason was the obvious one he tv as too
busy that having accomplished his at gage ment granted that was what he wanted he did not need to see me certainly he didn du
there was not even any date set for the wedding it was almost as though that very afternoon did not exist had never happened i
might not have even been there in the house worse i cou u have gone returned home and h would not have missed mei was
ids whatever it was he wanted of me not my being my presence just my existence whatever it was that rosa coldfield or any young
female no blood k into him represented in whatever it was he wanted because i will do him a is credit he had never once
thought about what he asked me to do until the mot nen the asked it because i know that he would not have waited two
months or even two days to ask it my presence was to him only the absence black morass and snarled vine and creeper to that
man who had juggled through a swamp with nothing to guide or drive himno hope no light only some incorrigibility of un defeat and blundered
at last and without warning on to dry solid ground and sun and air if there could have been such thing as sun to him
if anyone or anything could have competed with the white glare of his madness yes mad yet not so mad because there is a practicality
to viciousness the thief the liar the murderer even has faster rules than virtue ever has why not madness too if he was mad it
was only his compelling dream which was insane and not his methods it was no madman who bargained and cajoled hard manual labor out of
men like jones it was no madman who kept clear of the sheets and hoods and night galloping horses with which men who were once
his acq ud nt ances even if not his fn ends discharged the canker suppuration of d feat it was nomad mans plan or tactics
which gained him at the lowest possible price the sole woman available to wive him and by the one device which could have gained his
point not madman no since surely there is something in madness even the demoniac which satan flees aghast a this own handiwork and which god
looks on in pity some spark some crumb to leaven and redeem that articulated flesh that speech sight hearing taste and being which we call
human man but no matter i will tell you j what he did and let you he the judge or try to tell you because
d tere are something s for which three words are three too many and three thousand words that many words too less and this is
one of them bean he told i could ted te then many sentences repeat the l bold blank naked and outrageous words just as he
spoke them and bequeath you only that same aghast and outraged unbelief i ht ew when i comprehended what he meant or take three thousand
sentences and leave you only that why why and why that i have asked and listened to for almost ff iy years but i will
let you he the judge and let you tell me if i was not right you see ii vas that sun or thought i was
who did believe there was that spark that crumb in madness which is divine thot i gh madness known o word itself for terror or
for pity there was an ogre of my childhood which b fore my birth removed my only sister to its grim ogre hou me and
produced two half phantom children who mi was not encouraged and did not desire to associate with as if my late born solitude had taught
me present i met it of that fateful intertwining warned me of that fatal snarl y climax before i knew the name for murder and
i forgave it there iv as a shape which rode away beneatha flag and demon or no courageously suffered and i did more than just
forgive islet vit because the body the blood the memory which that ogre had dwelt in returned five years later and held out its hand
and said come as you might say it to a dog and i came yes the body die face un th the right name and
memory even the correct remembering of what and whom except myself and was that not hut further proof it had left behind and returned to
but nott lte ogre villain true enough hut a mortal fallible one less to invoke fear than pity but no ogre mad true enough but
it old myself why should not madness be its own victim also or why may it be not even madness but solitary despair in titan
conflict with the lonely and fore doomed and indomitable iron spirit but no ogre because it was dead vanished consumed somewhere inflame and sulphur reek
perhaps among the lonely crc y peaks of my childhoods solitary remembering or forgetting i was that sun who believed that he after thu evening
in judith s room was not oblivious of me hut only u mons dous and receptive like the swamp freed pilgrim feeling cartel and tang
sun is md light again and aware of neither hut only of darkness and morass look toho did believe there was that magic in tmk
in blood which we call by the pallid name of love that ivo ul dbe might be sun for him though i the youngest we
a he st where judith and c ly tie both would cast no shadow yes i the youngest there yet potent ly without t neas
u red and measurable age since i alone of them could say furious mad oldman i hold no substance that will ft your dream but
i can give you airy space and scope for your delirium and the none afternoon oh there was a fate in it afternoon and afternoon
and afternoon do you see the death of hope and love the death of pride and principle and then the death of everything save the
old outraged and aghast mb elk ving which has lasted for forty t kee years he returned to the house and called me shouting from
the hack gallery until i came down oh it old you he had not thought of it until that moment that pre n longed moment
which contained the distance between the house and wherever it was he had been standing when he thought of it and this too coincident it
was the very day on which he knew definitely and at last exactly how much of his hundred square miles he would be able to
save and keep and call his own on the daywhen he would have to die that no matter what happened to him now he would
atleast retain the shell of s ut pens hundred eventhough a better name for it would now be s ut pens one called shouted forme
until came dawn he had not even waited to tether his horse he stood with there in s over his armand no hand on my
head now and spake the bald outrageous tv or ds exactly as if he were consulting with jones or with some other man about a
bitch dog or a co worm are they will have told you how i came back heme oh yes i know roi ecole ld lose
him weep him caught a man but couldnt keep him oh yes i know and kind too they would he kind rosa coldfield warped bitter
orphaned country stick mlle i rosa cole ld set y engaged at last and so off the j own i file county they will have
told you how i went out there to live for the rest of my life seeing in my ne phe us murdering an act of
code nah ling me ostensibly to obey my dying sisters request that i save atleast one of the two child rm which she had doomed
by conceiving them but actually to be in the house when he returned who being a demon would the rfb re be impervious to shot
and shell and so would return i waiting for him because i was young still iv ho had buried no hopes to bugles beneatha flag
and ripe for marrying in this time and place where most of the young men were dead and all the living ones either old or
cd ready married or tired too tired for love he my best my only chance in this an environment where at best and even lacking
war my chances would have been slender enough since i was not only a southern gentlewoman but the very modest character of whose background and
circumstances must needs be their own affirmation since had been the daughter of awed thy planter i could have married almost anyone but being the
daughter merely of as mdl storekeeper i could even afford to accept fi owe rsf iom almost noone and so would have been doomed to
marry at last some casual app rent ke clerk in my fat kers hu sines s yes they will have told you who was young
and had buried hopes only during that night which was four years long when beside a shuttered and un sleeping candles he embalmed the war
and its i writ age of suffering and injustice and sorrow on the backsides of the pages within an old account book e mhd ming
blotting from the breathable air die poisonous secrete f flu vi um of lusting and haring and killing they will have told you daughter of
an em bus que tv ho had to turn to a demon a villain and therefore she had been right in haring her father since
if he had not died in that ett tics he would not have had togo out there to find food and protection and shelter and
if die had not had to depend on his food and clothing even if she did help to grow and weave it to keep her
alive and warm until simple justice demanded that she mc dee what return for it it e might require of her com mm u rate
wh hm a iq she would not have become engaged to him and if she had not be a me engaged to him she would
not have had to tie at night asking herself why and why and why as she has done for forty three years as if she
had been instinctively right even as a child in hating her father and so these forty three years of impotent and unbearable outrage were the
revenge on her of some sophisticated and ironic sterile nature for having hated that which gave her life yes rosa coldfield engaged at last who
lacking the fact that her sister had bequeathed her atleast something of shelter and mn might have become a charge upon the town and now
rosie coll d lose him weep him found a man but failed to keep him rosa coll d who would be right only being right
is not enough for women who had rather be wrong than just that who want the man who was wrong to admit it and that
s what she cant forgive him for not for the insult not even for having jilted him but for being dead oh yai blow i
knowhow two months later they learned that she had pa deed up her belongings that is put on the shawl and hat again and comeback
to town to live alone in the house where her parents were dead and gone and where judith would come now ani then and bring
her some of what food they had out at s ut pens hundred and which only dire necessity the brute in exp lk a bk
flesh s stubborn tv ill to live brought miss coldfield to a a xp t and it d ke indeed because now the to iv

she had known a imp let ely how who had had only the freshman year at gardening and doubtless would not have worked it if
she had kno um re a thing du rough die garden fence and gathering ve get db les d unh she wot dd have been

to keep from being seen stealing that sent her forth before the to ivn was awake because if she had had a he would have
sent him forth in broad daylight to forage where she wot di not have cared exactly as the cavalry heroes iv hom she wrote verse
about would have sent their men yes rosie coldfield lose him weep him caught a beau but co tdd nt keep him ph yes they
will tell you found a beau and was insulted something heard and not forgiven not so much for the saying of it but for having
thou g lu it about her so that when she heard it she realized like thunderclap that it must have been in his mind for
a day a week even a month maybe he looking at her daily with that in his mind and she not even knowing it but
i forgave him they will tell you different but i did why shouldnt ii had nothing to forgive i had not lost him because in
ever omi ed him a certain segment of rotten mud walked into my life spoke that tome which i had never he t md before
and never shall again and then walked out that was dl in ever owned him certainly not in that sewer sense which you would mean
by that and maybe think but you are mong i mean that did not matter that was not even the nub of the in d
time an that he was not owned by anyone or anything in this world had never been would never be not even by ellen not
even by jones granddaughter because he was not art i a dated in this world he was a walking shadow he was the light blinded
bat like image of his own torment cast by the fierce demoniac lantern up from beneath the earths crust and hence in retrograde reverse from
abysmal and chaotic dark to eternal and diy s mal dark completing his descending do you mark the gradation ellipsis clinging trying to cling with
vain unsubstantial hands to wh ti he hoped would hold him save him arrest him ellen do you mark them myself then last of dl
that fid her less daughter of wash jones only child who so i heard once died in a memphis brothel to j in is cve
ref ux even if not rest and peace at last in the stroke of a rusty scythe i was told informed of that too though
not by jones this time but by someone else kind enough to turn aside and tell me he iv as dead dead i cried dead
you you lie you re not dead heaven cannot and hell dare not have you but quentin was not listening because t be re was
also something which he too could not pass that door the running feet on the stairs beyond it almost a continuation of die faint shot
the two women then egress and the white girl in her under things made of flour sacking when there had been flour of window curtains
when not pausing lookup at the door the yellowed creamy mass of old intricate satin and lace spread carefully on the bed and then caught
sw if dy up by the white g jr land held before her as the door a ashed in and the brother stood there hades
s with his shaggy bayonet trimmed hair his gaunt worn unshaven face his patched and faded gray tunic the pistol still hanging against his flank
the two of them bro die rand sister curiously a like as if the di fie rence in sex had merely sharpened the common blood
to a terrific an almost unbearable similarity speaking to one another in short brief staccato sentences like slaps as if they stood breast to breast
striking one another in turn neither making any attempt to guard against the blows now you cant marry him why can ti marry him because
he s dead dead yes i killed him he quentin couldnt pass that he was not even listening to her he said maa mj what
s that what did you say j there s something in that house in that houses its clyde dont she no something living in it

they mean by that s it t ce it has always seemed to ate that the only painless de ruh must be that which tes
the intelligence by violent surprise and from the rear so to sped t since if death be anything at all beyond ab riff and peculiar

aught can be more painful to any intelligence above that of a child or at idiot than a slow and gradual confronting with that which
over along period of bewilderment and dread it has been taught to regard as an irrevocable and un plumb abl c finality i dom th
to wit a it d if there can be either access of comfort or cessation t f pain in the ultimate escape from a stubborn
and amazed outrage which over a period of forty three years has been companionship and bread and fire and all ido not hno iv that
either the letter bringing with it that very september evening itself and he soon needing required to say non either aunt cousin nor uncle rosa
miss rosa coldfield an old lady that died young of outrage in one summer and then shi eve said you means he was no k

did she die for and that not s hr eves first time nobody s first time in cambridge since september tell about the south what

mr comp son stopped talking atlas the quentin walked out of his others talking at last because it was now time togo not because he
had heard it all because he had not been listen hig since he had something which he still was unable to pass that door that
gaunt tragic dramatic self i hypnotized youthful face like the tragedian in a college play an academic hamlet waked from some trance ment of the
curtains falling and blundering across the dusty ste from which the rest of the cast had departed last commencement the sister facing him across the
wedding dress which she was not to use not even to finish the two of them slashing at one another with twelve or fourteen words
and most of these the same words repeated two or three times so that when you boded it down they did it with eight or
ten and she miss coldfield had on the shawl as he had known she would and the bonnet black once but faded now to that
fierce muted metallic green of old peacock feathers ig all the keys which the house possessed cupboard closet and door some of w li ich
would not even turn in locks which shot home could be solved by any child with a hairpin or awad of chewing gum some of
which no longer even fitted the locks they had been made for like old married people who no longer have anything in common to door
tx talk about save the same general weight of air to displace and breathe and general oblivious bidi r earth to bear their weight that
evening the twelve miles bch md the fat marcin the moon less september dust the trees along the road not rising soaring as trees should
but squat t mg like huge fowl th hr leaves ruffled and heavily separate hk e the feathers of panting fowls heav with sixty days
of dust the roadside undergrowth coated wit li heat vulcanized dust and seen through the dust cloud in which the horse and buggy moved appeared
hk e masses straining delicate and rigid and i mmo bly upward at perpendiculars absolute in some old dead volcanic water ref med to the
oxygen less first principle of liquid the dust cloud in which the buggy moved not blowing away because it had been raised by no wind
and was supported by no air but evoked materialized about them instantaneous and eternal cubic foot for cubic foot of dust to cubic foot for
cubic foot of horse and buggy peripatetic beneath the branch shredded vistas of flat black fiercely and heavily starred sky the dust cloud moving on
enclosing them with not threat exactly but maybe warning bland almost f ii end ly warning as if to say come on if you like
but i will get there first accumulating ahead of you i will arrive frs tj lifting sloping gently upward under hooves and wheels so that
you wilt find no destination hut will merely abrupt ger u lyon to a pit teau and a panorama f harmless and inscrutable night and
there will be nothing for you to do hut return and so i would advise you m not togo to turn back not if and
let what is be he quentin agreeing to this sitting in the buggy beside the implacable doll sized old woman clutching her cotton umbrella smelling
the heat d is tiu ed old woman flesh the heat distilled camphor in the old fold creases of the shawl feeling exactly like an
electric bulb blood and skin since the buggy disturbed not enough air to cool him with motion created not a i ough motion within him
to make his skin sweat thinking good lord yes lets dont find him or it try to find him or it risk disturbing hint or
it the nsh re ve again wait wait you mean that this old gal this aunt rosa miss rosa quentin said all ih tall right
that this old dame this aunt rosa miss rosa i tell you all right all right all right that this old this aunt r all
right all right all right all right that had nt been out there had nt set foot in the house even in forty three years
yet who not only said there was somebody hidden in it but found somebody that would believe her would drive that twelve miles out d
here in a buggy at midnight to see if she was right or not yes quentin said that this old dame that grew up in
a household like an overpopulated mausoleum with no call or claim on her rime but the hating of her father and aunt and her sisters
husband in peace and comfort and waiting for the daywhen they would prove not only to themselves but to everybody else that she had been
right so one night the aunt slid down the rain pipe with a horse trader and she was right about the aunt so that fixed
that then her father nailed himself up in the attic to keep from being drafted into the rebel army and carved to death so that
fixed that except for the unavoidable possibility that when the moment came for him to admit to s himself th ac she had been right
he it i ay not have been able to speak or may not have had anyone to tell it to so she was right about
the father too since if he had nt made general lee and jeff davis mad he wouldnt have had to nail himself up and die
and if he had nt died he wouldnt have left her an orphan and a pauper and so situated left s usc ep nb leto
a situation v here she could receive this mortal affront and right about the brother in law because if he had nt been a demon
his cli il d ren wouldnt have needed protection from him and she wouldnt have had togo out there and be betrayed by the old
meat and find instead of a widowed agamemnon to her cassandra an ancient stiff jointed pyramus to her eager di ough untried this be who
could approach her in this unbidden april s compounded demon ry and suggest that d icy breed together for test and sample and if it
was a boy they would marry would not have had to be blown back to town on the in it iai blast of that horror
and outrage to eat of galland wormwood stolen through paling fences at dawn so this was not fixed at all and forever because she couldnt
event eu it because of who her successor was not because he found a successor by just turning around and no days loss of time
even but because of who the successor was that she might conceivably have ever suf lf ered a situation where she co idd or would
have to decline any office which her successor could have been deemed worthy even by a demon to fill this not fixed at all since
when the moment came for him to admit he had been wrong she would have the same trou bk with him she had with her
father he would be dead too s iur pae doubtless foresaw the scythe if for no other reason than that it would be the final
outrage and a ff iron t like the tia mmer and nails in her fathers business that scythes y tn boli c laurel of a
caesars triumph rtha trusty scythe loaned by the demon himself tx jones more than two years ago to cut tj if i weeds away from
the shanty doorway to smooth die path for rutting that rusty blade garlanded wi dh each successive days gaudy ribbon or cheap bead for the
i ow did she put it slut wasnt all was it to walkin that scythe beyond whose symbolic shape he eventhough dead even when earth
itself declined any longer to bear his weight jeered a the ry ra quentin said that this faustus this demon this be el zebub fled
hiding f iom some momentary flashy glare of his creditors outraged fec e exasperated beyond a e endurance hiding scuttling into respectability like a jackal
into a rock pile so she thought at first until she realized that he was not hiding did not want to hide was merely engaged
in one final frenzy of evil and harm doing before the creditor overtook him next time for good and all this faustus who appeared suddenly
one sunday with two pistols and twenty subsidiary demons and s kuh dug ged a hundred miles of land out of a poor ignorant indian
and built the biggest house on it you ever saw and went away with six wagons and came back with the crystal tapestries and the
wedgwood chairs to furnish it and nobody knew if he had robbed another steamboat or had just dug up ali ole more of the old
loot who hid horns and tail beneath human raiment and a beaver hat and chose bought her out swapped his father in law wasnt it
a wife after three years to scrutinize weigh and compare not fi rom one of the local ducal houses but fi rom the lesser baron
age whose principality was so far decayed that there would be no risk of his wife bringing him for dowry delusions of grandeur before he
should be equipped for it yet not so far decayed but that she might keep them both from getting lost among the new knives and
forks and spoons that he had bought a wife who not only would consolidate the hiding but could would and did breed ii in i
two children to fend and shield both in themselves and indie ir progeny the brittle bones and tired flesh of an oldman against die daywhen
the creditor would run him to earth for the last time and he couldnt getaway and so sure enough the daughter fell in love dies
on the agent for the providing of that liv mg bulwark between him the demon and the creditors bailiff hand until the son should marry
and thus in sure him doubled and compounded and then the demon must turn square around and run not only the fiance out of the
house and not only the son out of the house but so corrupt seduce and mesmerize the son that he the son should do the
office of the outraged fathers pistol hand when fornication threatened so that the demon should return from the war five years later and find accomplished
and complete the situation he had been working for son fled for good now with a noose behind him daughter doomed to spinsterhood and then
almost bef iii c his foot was out of the stirrup he the demon set out and got himself en ged again in order to
replace that progeny the hopes of wh idi heh himself destroyed yes quentin said came back home and found his chances of descendants gone where
his children had attended to that and his plantation ruined fields fallow except for a finest and of weed and taxes and levies and penalties
sowed by united stales marshals and such and all his gone where the yankees had attended to that and you would have though the would
have been satisfied yet before his foot was out of the stirrup he not only set out to try to restore his plant a don
to what it used to be like maybe he was hoping to fool the creditor by illusion and obfuscation by concealing behind the illusion that
time had not elapsed and change occurred die bet that he was now almost sixty years until he could get hm self a new bat
di of d ii ld ren to bulwark him but chose for this purpose the last woman on earth he might have hoped to prevail
on this aunt r all right all right all right that hated him that had always hated him yet choosing her with a kind of

the store to rebuild the plantation who had escaped twice now got himself into it and been freed by the creditor whose this children to
destroying one another before he had posterity and he decided that maybe he was wrong in being free and so got into it again and
then decided dia the was wrong in being unfree and so got out of it again and then turned right around and bought his way

helped the granddaughter to fashion adress to walk past the lounging men in the side looking and the tongue sim til her increasing belly taught
her embarrassment or perhaps fear jones who before i had not even been allowed to approach the front of the house and who during the

was hopeless blind jones who apparently saw still in that furious led te rous wreck dte old fine figure of the man who once galloped

and his father crossed just as the rain began to comedown again gray and so hd and slow making no sound quentin not aware yet
of just where they were because he had been riding within s head lowered against the drizzle until he looked up the slope before them
where the wet yellow sedge died upward into the rain like melting gold and saw the grove the clump of cedars on the crest of

fields beyond which would be the oak grove and the gray huge rotting deserted house half a mile av vay mr comp son had stopped
to look back at luster on the mule the tow sack he had been using for saddle now wrapped around his head his knees drawn
up under it leading the horses on down the ditch to find a place to cross better get on out of the rain mr comp
son said he s not going to come within a hundred yards of those cedars anyway they went on up the slope they could not
see the two dogs at all only the steady furrowing of the sedge where invisible the dogs quartered the slope until one of them flung
up his head to look back mr comp son gestured with his hand toward the trees he and quentin following it was dark among the
cedars the light more dark than gray even die quiet rain the faint pearly globules materializing on the gun barrels and the five headstones like
drops of not quite congeal cd melting sfio m cold candles on the marble the two flat heavy vaulted slabs the other three headstones leaning
a little awry with here and there a carved letter or even anoa tire word momentary and legible in the faint bgh t which the

where miss coldfield possibly maybe doubtless looked at it everyday as though it were his portrait possibly maybe doubtless here too reading among the lettering
more of maiden hope and virgin expectation than she ever told quentin about since she never mentioned the stone to him at all and the
demon drank the parched com coffee an date the hoe cake which judith and c ly tie prepared for him and kissed judith on the
forehead and said well clyde and returned to the war all in twenty four hours he could see i the might even have been there

for her sure enough if she had wanted to put beloved husband of on that first one ah mr comp son said that was the
one your grand it her attended to judith came into town one day and brought him the money some of it where she got it
from he never knew unless it was what she had left out of the price of the store which he sold for her brought the
money in with the inscription except the date of death of course all written out as you see it during that three weeks while clyde
was in new orleans finding the boy to fetch him back though your grandfather of course did not know this money and inscription not for
herself but for him oh quentin said yes they lead beautiful lives women lives not only divorced from but irrevocably excommunicated from all reality that
s why although their deaths the instant of dissolution are of no importance to them since they have a courage and fortitude in the face
of pain and annihilation which would make the most spartan man resemble apu ling boy yet to them their fun ers js and graves the
little puny affirmations of spurious in un or tal it y set above tli eir slumber are of m calculable importance you had an aunt
once you do not remember her because in ever saw her myself but only heard the tale who was faced with a serious operation which
she became convinced she would not survive at a time when her nearest female kin was a woman between whom and herself there had existed
for years one of those bitter inexplicable to the man mind amicable enmities which occur between women of the same blood whose sole worry about
departing this world was to get rid of a certain brown dress which she owned and knew that the kinswoman knew she had never hk
ed which must be burned not given away but burned in the backyard beneath the window whereby being held up to the window and suffering
ex cr uti at in gpa in she could see it burned with her own eyes because she was convinced that after she died the
kinswoman the logical one to take charge would bury her in it and did she diet quentin said no as soon as the dress was
consumed she began to mends he stood the operation and recovered and outlived the kinswoman by several years the none afternoon she died peacefully of
no particular ailment and was buried in her wedding gown oh quentin said yes but there w one afternoon in the summer of when one
of these graves there were only three here then was actually watered by tears your grandfather saw it that was the year judith sold the
store and your grand fet her attended to it for her and he had ridden out to see her about the matter and he witnessed
it the interlude the ceremonial widowhood s bright dramatic pageantry he didnt know at the time how ff ie oct oro on came to l
x here how judith could even have known about her to write her where bo niz was dead but there she was with the ei
even year cl d boy who looked more like eight it must have resembled a garden scene by the irish poet wilde the late afternoon
the dark cedars with the level sun in them even the lig br exactly right and the graves the three pieces of marble your grandfather
had advanced judith the money to buy the third stone with against the price of the store looking as though they had been cleaned and
polished and arranged by scene shifter s who with the passing of twilight would return and strike them and carry them hollow fragile and without
weight back to the warehouse until they should be needed again the pageant the scene the act entering upon the stage the magnolia faced woman
a ht tle plumper now a woman created of by and for darkness whom the artist beardsley might have dressed in a soft flowing gown
designed not to infer bereavement or widowhood but to dress some interlude of slumbrous and fatal in s at i ation of passionate and inexorable
hunger of the flesh walking beneatha lace parasol and followed by a bright gigantic n egress carrying a silk cushion and leading by the band
the lit de boy whom beardsley might not only have dressed but drawn a th indelicate child with a smooth ivory sexless face who after
his mother handed then egress the parasol and took the cuon and knelt beside die grave and arranged her skirts and wept never released then
egress apron but stood blinking ju ie dy who having been bom and lived all his life in a kind of silken prison lighted by
perpetual shaded candles breathing for air the milk like and absolutely physical am ben ce which his mothers days and hours emanated had seen lit
de enough of sunlight before let alone out of doors trees and gra and ear di and last of all the other woman judith who
not bereaved did not need to mourn quentin thought thinking yes i have had to lien too long who stood just in nde die cedars
in the calico dress and the sunbonnet to match it both ded and shapeless the calm face the hands which could plow or cut wood
and cook or weave cloth folded before her standing in the attitude of an in different guide in a museum waiting probably not even watching
then then egress came and handed the oct oro on a crystal bottle to smell and helped her to rise and took up the silk
cushion and gave the oct oro on the parasol and they returned to the house the ht tle boy still holding to then egress apron
then egress supporting the woman with one armand judith following wit ii that face like a mask or like marble back to the house across
the tall scaling portico and into the house where c ly tie was cooking the eggs and the com bread on which she and judith
lived she stayed a weeks he passed the rest of that week in the one remaining room in the house whose bed had linen sheets

impregnated behind the sagging closed blinds with the heavy fainting odor of her flesh her days her hours her garments of eau de cologne from

to the door to receive the trays which dy tic carried up the stairs c ly tie who did that fetching and carrying as judith
made her who must have perceived whether judit ii told her or not that it was another whom she served yet who served then egress

the coarsest com bread spread wi dias coarse molasses this surreptitiously not that the mother or the du enna might object bat because the household
did not have f eod for eating between meals gave it to him thrust it at him with restrained savageness and who found him one
afternoon playing with a boy about his own size in the road outside die gat pg and cursed the child out of sight with level

was not anything except calm who to him did not even have a name yet but who was somehow so closely related to him as

demarcation not led not dragged but driven and herded by that stem implacable presence into that gaunt and barren household where his very silken remaining

him as if he were a spanish virgin who even before she could have even suspected that he would ever come there to live had

the incredulous and shocked spec uk don of your grandfather who though he had that hundred dollars and the written directions in judith shand for
this fourth tombstone in his safe at the rime had not yet associated the boy with the child he had seen two years ago when
the oct oro on came there to weep at the grave to be u cvc that the child might be clyde s got by its

him and die re was only your grandfather to couple at last the boy the youth with the child who had been there three or
four years ago to visit that grave it was your grand f el her to whose office judith came that afternoon five years later and
he could not remember when he had seal her in je fier son before the woman of forty now in the same shap des s

he never referred to and which the woman who even a year later and after their son was bom still existed in that aghast and
automaton hk estate in which she had arrived did not possibly could not recount but which she seemed to exude gradually and by a process
of terrific and incredulous excretion like die sweat of fear or anguish how he had found her dragged her out of whatever two dimensional backwater

the son was bom in one of the dilapidated slave cabins which he rebuilt after renting his parcel of land from judith how there followed
something like a year composed of a succession of periods of utter kor mob di ty like a broken cinema film w fai the white
colored man who had married her spent on his back recovering from the last mauling he had received in frowzy stinking rooms in places towns
and cities which likewise had no names to her broken by other periods intervals of furious and incomprehensible and apparently reason less mo vic progression
a maelstrom of faces and bodies through which the man thrust dragging her behind him toward or from what driven by what fury which would
not let him rest she did not know each one to end finish as the one before it had so that it was almost a

illness from time to time between the woman who had been widowed before she had been a bride and the son of the man who
had bereaved her and a hereditary concubine who had not resented his black blood so much as he had denied the white and this with
a curious and outrageous exaggeration in which was inherent its own ir re voc a bih ty almost ex a e dyas the demon himself

had vanished and then returned with an authentic wife resembling something in a zoo now farmed on shares a portion of the s ut pen

would come and take him away or if he were too drunk had become violent the town officers and keep him until his wife the
black gargoyle could hitch the team back into the wagon and come with nothing alive about her but her eyes and hands and load him
into it and take him so they did not even miss him fi rom town at first it was the county medical officer who told
your grandfather tli a the had ye qo w vex and that judith had had him moved into the big house and was nursing him
and now judith had the disease too and your grandfather told him to notify miss coldfield and he your grand fet her rode out there
one day he did not dismount he s a this horse and called until clyde looked down at him from one of the upper windows
and told him d bey didnt need nothing within the week your grand fr the r learned that clyde had been right or was right
now anyway though it was judith who died first oh quentin said yeshe thought too much too long remembering how he had looked at the
fifth grave and thought how whoever had buried judith must have been afraid that the other dead would contract the disease from her since her
grave was at the opposite side of the enclosure as f iur from the other four as the enclosure would permit thinking fat lier wont
have to say thin this time because he knew who had ordered and bought that headstone before he read the in scrip don on it
thinking about imagining what cam ful printed dire c dons judith must have roused herself from delirium possibly to write down fi ir clyde when
she knew that she was going to die and how c ly t fe must have lived during the ne jct twelve ye an while
she raised d he child wh i a had been bom in the old slave cabin and scrimped and sad die money to finish paying

to ref i is e it she clyde set the rusty can full of nkk ds and dimes and frayed paper money on the desk

she was watching the mfi om behind the curtains of a window but that judge benbow would pay them she would enter the stores and
command objects from the shelves and showcases exactly as she commanded that two hundred dollar headstone from judge benbow and walkout of the store with

were not any older and you and luster had both been there that daywhen the five of you the five hoy s all of an
age began daring one another to enter the house long before you reached it coming up from the rear into the old street of the
slave quarters a jungle of sumach and persimmon and briers and honey stu kle and the rotting piles of what had once been log wall
sandstone chimneys and shingle roofs among the undergrowth except one that one you coming up to it you didnt see the old woman at all
at first because you were watching the boy the jim bond the hulking slack mouthed scd dle colored boy a few years older and bigger
than you were in patched and faded yet quite dean shirt and overalls too small for him working in the garden patch beside the cabin
so you didnt even know she was there until cd l of you started and whirled as one and found her wat eh ing you
from a chair tilted back against the cabin watt a little dried up woman not much bigger titan am of de ey and who mig

co j ee colored feet wrapped around the chair rung like monkeys do smoking a day pipe and watching you with eyes like two shoe

the pipe and in a voice almost like a white woman sw kat do you want and a fier a moment one of you said
nothing and th m you were c dlr ur ming without knowing which of you began to run first nor why since you were not

colored boy w hut stay wi dda to le woman and your father still watching you and you said spell it and luster said dat
s a lawyer word w hut dey puts you under when de law ketches you ides spells read in words and that was him the
name was bond now and he wouldnt care about that who had inherited what he was from his mother and only what he could never
have been from his father and if your father had asked him if he was charles bons son he not only would not have known
either he wouldnt have cared and if you had told him he was it would have touched and then vanished from what you no the
would have had to call his mind long before it could have setup any reaction at all c it her of pride or pleasure anger
or grief yes quentin said and he lived in that cabin behind the haunted house for twenty six years he and the old woman who
must be more dian seventy now yet who had no white hair under that head rag whose flesh had hot sagged but looked instead like
she had grown old up to a certain point just like normal people do then had stopped and instead of turning gray and soft she
had be gim to shrink so that the skin of her face and hands broke into a million tiny cross hair wrinkles and her body
just grew smaller and smaller like something beings hn mk in aft i mace like the bot nes edo th dr captured heads zx s
who might well have been the ghost if one was ever needed if anybody ever his o little else to do as to prowl around
the house wh idi there was not if there could have been any dung in it to protect from prowlers which i hace was not
if there had ien anyone of them left to hide or need concealment in it which there was not and yet this old gal this
aunt rosa told you that someone was hiding om there and you said it was clyde or jim bond and she said no and you
said it would have to be because the demon was dead and judi uh was dead and bon was dead and henry neso far he
had nt even left a grave and e said no and so you went out there drove the twelve miles at night in a buggy
and you found clyde and bond both mit and you said you see and she the aunt rosa still said no and so you went
on and there was yes wait the nsh re ve said for gods sake watt vii j here was no snow on s hr eves

i they had finished all the brick and had the f ii und a dons laid and most of the big timbers cut and trimmed
and one day the architect couldnt stand it anymore or he was afi nid he would starve or that the wild and maybe colonels ut
pen too wo u u run out of grub and eat him or maybe he got homesick or maybe he just had togo maybe he
had a girls hr eve said or maybe he just wanted a you said die demon md the didnt have but two quentin did not
answer this d the rag he might not have heard talking in that curious repressed calm voice as though to the table be fine him
or the hookup on it or the k tter up cm the boor his hands lying on either a de of the book and so
he went he seemed to vanish in broad day i it right out fix im the middle of twenty one people or maybe it vr
as jus nt pens back di at was turned md d wta ii the saw him go and didnt think it needed mentioning that being
wu d men tie y probably didnt know what s ut pen himself was up to and him naked in the mud with them all
days oi reckon the never did kno vr what the architect was there for supposed to door had done or could door was so maybe
they thoughts ut pen had sent him told him togo away and drown himself go away and die or maybe just go away so he
did jumped up in broad daylight in his embroidered vest and f aunt leroy tie and a hat like a baptist congressman and probably carrying
the hat in his hand and ran into the swamp and the watched him out of sight and then went back to work and s
ut pen didnt even miss him until nights upper time probably and the told iii m and he declared a holiday tomorrow because he would
have to gp tout and borrow some dogs not that he would have needed dogs with his to trail but maybe he thought that the
guests the others would not be used to trailing with and would expect dogs and grandfather he was young then too brought some champagne and
some of the others brought whiskey and they began to gather out the real it de after sundown at s ut pens house that didnt
even have walls yet that wasnt anything yet but some lines of bricks sunk into the ground but that was all right because they didnt
goto bed anyhow grand fet her said they just s at around the fire with the champagne and the whiskey and a quarter of the
last venison s ut pen had killed and about midnight the man with the dogs came then it was daylight and the dogs had al
it de trouble at first because some of the wild niter s had run out about a mile of the trail just for fun but
they got the trail straightened out at last the dogs and the in the bottom and most of the men tiding along the edge of
it where the going was good but grand the rand colonels ut pen went wit i it ii e dogs and die boa os es
ut pea was afraid die niggas might catch the arch it ea before he could reach them he and grandfather had to walk a good
deal sending one of the to lead the hors on around the bad places until they could ride again grandfather said it was fine weather
and the trail lay pretty good but suf pen said it would have been fine if the architect had just waited and october or november
and so he to u grand fr the r something about himself s ut pens trouble was innocence all of a sudden he discovered not
what he wanted to do but what he just had to do had to do it whether he wanted to or not because if he
did not doi the knew that he could never live with himself for the rest of his life never live with what all the men
and women that had died to make him had left inside of him fer him to pass on with all the dead ones waiting and
watching to see if he was going to do it right fix things right so that he would be able to look in the face
not only the old dead ones but all the living ones that would come af rer him wh he would be one of the dead
and that at the vary moment when if fi discovered what it was he found out that this was the last thing in the world
he was equipped to do because he not only had not known that he would have to do this he hd not even know that
it existed to he wanted to need to be done i mdl he was almost fourteen years old because he was bom in west virginia
in the mountains not in west virginia s hr eve said what t quentin said not in wr at vi rg mi as hr eve
said because if he was twenty five years old in mississippi in he was bom in and there wasnt any west virgin kin because all
right quentin said west virginia wasnt admitted all rg jt tall right quentin said ir to the united states until all ih tall rigi it
all right quentin said he was bom where what few other people he knew lived in log cabins boiling with d bed ren like the
one he was bom in mc n and grown boys who hunted or lay before the fire on the floor while the women and older
girls stepped back and forth across them to read i the fire to cook where the only colored people were indians and you only looked
down at them over your rifle sights where he had never even heard of never imagined a place a land divided neatly up and actually
owned by men who did nothing but ride over it on fine horses or s it in fine clothes on the galleries of big houses
while other people worked for them he did not even imagine then that there was any such way to live or to want to live
or that there existed all the objects to be wanted which there were or that the ones who owned the objects not only could look
down on the ones that didnt but could be supported in the down looking not only by the others who owned objects too but by
di everyones that were looked down on that didn town objects and knew they never would because where he lived the land belonged to anybody
and everybody and so the man who would goto the trouble and work t once oca piece of it and say this is mine was
crazy and as for objects nobody had anymore of them than you did because everybody had just what he was strong oxo thor energetic enough
to take and keep and only that crazy man would goto the trouble to take or even want more than he could eat or swap
for powder and whiskey so he didnt even know dw re was a country all divided and fixed and neat with a people living on
it dl divided and fixed and neat because of what color their skins happened to be and what they happened to own ami where a
certain few men not only had the power of life nd d th and barter and sale over caer s but they had living human
ment opfer mac endless repetitive pet mal offices such as pouring the very whiskey from the jug and putting the glass into a mans hand
or pulling off boots for him togo to bed that all men have had to do for themselves s in a time began and would
have to do until they died and which noma never has or ever will like to do but which no mantha the knew had ever
thought of evading anymore than he had thought of evading the effort of chewing and swallowing and breathing when he was a child he f
fid nt listen to the vague and doud y tales of tidewater splendor that penetrated even his mountains because then he could not understand what
the people who told about it meant and when he became a boy he didnt listen to them because there was nothing in right to
compare and gauge the tales by and so give the words life and meaning and no chance that he ever would understand what they meant
because he was too busy doing the tiling s that boys do and when he got to be a youth and curiosity itself edi ume
d the tales which he did not know he had heard and speculated on he was interested and would have liked to see the places
once but without envy or he cao se he just thought that some people were spawned in one place and some in another some w
ned lucky he may have called it and some not and tii at so he told grandfather the mm themselves had ht tie to do
with the choo ring and less of the regret because it had never once occurred to him that any man should take any such blind
acd dent as that as authority or warrant to look down a to the o any others so he had hardly heard of such a
wo im until he foil into it that show it was they into it the who fe fan u lyre tu molto the coast from
w hid b the first sue n had come when the ship f iom the old bailey teach jamestown probably tumbled head over heels back
to tid swat ear by tii ecr a it i to dei elevation and gta vit yas if whatever s hh out te family had
had on the mountain had broken he said something to grandfather about his mother ding about that time and how his pap said she was
a fine wear mg woman and that he would miss her and something about how it was the vi fe that had go this father
even that far west and now the whole passel of them from the father through the grown daughters down to one that couldnt even walk
yet slid back down out of the mountains skating in a kind of accelerating and sloven and inert coherence like a useless collection of flotsam
on a flooded river moving by some perverse auto motivation such as inanimate objects sometimes show backward against the very current of the stream across
the virginia plateau and into the slack lowlands about the mouth of the james river he didnt know why they moved or didnt remember the
reason if he ever knew it whether it was optimism hope in his fathers breast or nostalgia since he didnt know just where his father
had come fi rom whether from the country to which they returned or not or even if his father knew remembered wanted to remember and
find it again he didnt know whether somebody some traveler had told him of some easy place or time some escape from the hardship of
getting food and keeping warm in the mountain way or if perhaps somebody his father knew once or who knew his father once and remembered
him happened to think about him or someone k into him who had tried to forget him and couldnt quite do it had sent for
him and he had obeyed going not for the promised job but for the ease having faith perhaps in the blood kinship to evade the
labor if it was kinship and in his own inertia and in whatever gods had watched over him this far if it were not but
all he remembered the demons hr eve said was that one morning the father rose and told the older girls to pack what food they
had and somebody wrapped up the baby and somebody else threw water on die fire and a ey walked down the mountain to where roads
existed they had a lopsided two wheeled cart and two spa vii ed oxen now he to h grandfather he did notre manber just where
nor when nor how his fet her had got it h few as tel then the two older boys had left home sometime before and
had not be a a heard of since he d roi re the oxen since almost as soon as they got the car this fi
it her began the practice of accomplishing that part of the translation devoted to motion fiat on his back in the cart oblivious among the
quilts and lanterns and well buckets and bundles of clothing and d ii ld ren snoring with alcohol that was how he told i the
didnt remember if it was weeks or months or a year they t rav ded except that one of the older girls who had left
the cabin unmarried was still unmarried when they finally stopped though she had become a mother before they lost the last blue mountain range ffe
didnt remember whether it was that winter and then spring and then summer that overtook and passed them on the road or vd ietf aer
they overtook and passed in dow succ eon the seasons as they descended or whet ho it was the descent itself that did it and
they not pn res h parallel in time but descending pei pen dia fia rly through temper attire and dima tea you couldnt call it
a period because as he remember editor as he told grand f other he did k didnt have either a definite he mm gora definite
ending maybe attenuation is better a a attenuation fi oma kind of furious inertness and patient immobility while they satin the cart outside die doors
of dowries and taverns and waited for the fo d ter to dr f ok himself in sen sibi e to a sort of dreamy
and destination less locomotion after dile y had t die oldman out of whatever shed or outhouse or barn or ditch and fo a ded
him into the carta in and dui hig w hid h they dh nc set en to pro grit tall w just to hang suspended
while the earth itself altered flattened and broadened out of the mountain cove where they had all been bom mounting rising about them like a
tide in which the strange harsh rough faces about the dogger y doors into which the oldman was just entering or was just being carried
or thrown out and this one time by a huge bull of a the first blackman slave they had ever seen who emerged with the
oldman over his shoulder like a sack of meal and his the mouth loud with laughing and full of teeth like tombstones swam up and
v am shed and were replaced the earth the world rising about them and flowing pastas if the cart moved on a treadmill and it
was now spring and now summer and they still were moving on toward a place they had never seen and had no conception of let
alone wanted togo to and from a place al it dc lost spot on the side of a hill back to which probably not one
of them could have led the way excepting possibly the usually insensible father who made one stage of the journey accompanied by the raspberry colored
elephants and snakes which he seems to have been hunting bringing into and then removing fi rom their sober static country astonishment the strange faces
and places both faces and places dogger ies and taverns now become hamlets hamlets now become villages villages now towns and the country flattened out
now with good roads and fields and working indie fields while white mens at fi nfl horses and watched them and more fine horses and
men in fine clothes with a different look in the face from mountain men about the taverns where the oldman was not even allowed to
come in by the front door and fi rom which his mountain drinking manners got him ejected before he would have time to get drunk
good so that now they began to make really pretty goodtime and no laughter and jeers to the ej a sing now even if the
ko gj it er and had been harsh and without much gentleness in them that s the way he got i the had learned the
difference not only between white men and blade ones but he was lea mii that there was a difference between white men and white men
not to be measured by lifting anvils or gouging eyes or how much whiskey you could drink then getup and walkout of the room he
had begun tod is es m that without being aware of it ye the still thought that that was just a matter of where you
were spawned and how whether you were lucky or not lucky and that the lucky ones would be even slower and leather than the unlucky
to take any advantage of it or credit for it or to feel that it gave them anything more than the luck and he still
thought that they would fec i if anything more tender toward the unlucky db an the im lucky would ever need to fed toward them
he was to find all that out later he remembered when he found it out because that was the same second wha i he discovered
his innocence it was not the second the moment that he was long about it was the getting to it the moment when they must
have realized believed at last di at they were no longer t rav ding moving going somewhere not the being still at last and in
a fe shi on settled because they had done that before on the road he remembered how one time the gradual di fier eu ff
i in comfort between the presence and absence of shoes and warm do thing occurred in one place a cow shed where the sisters baby
was bom and as he told grandfather fi jr all he could remember concave d too because they were stopped now atlas the didnt know
where they were for a time during the first days or wed csor months the woodsman s instinct which he had acquired fira m the
environment w lk xe he grew up or that maybe had been bequeathed him by the two la others who had varo she done of
whom had s been as far west as the mississippi river one tim ft the instinct bequeathed him along with the w om out buckskin
garments and sud h which they left in the cabin when they departed die last time for goo and which he had sharpened by boys
practice at small game and such kept him oriented so that he could have so he said found his way back to the mountain cabin
in time but that was past now behind him the moment when he last could have said ex aed y where he had been bom
he was now weeks and months maybe a year since he became confused about his age and was never able to straighten it out again
so that he told grandfather that he did not know within a year on either side just how old he was so he knew neither
where he had come from nor where he was nor why he was just there surrounded by the faces almost all the faces which he
had ever known though the number of them was decreasing thinning out despite the efforts of the un marr d sister who pretty soon so
he told grandfather and still without any we dd high ad another baby decreasing because of the climate the warmth the dampness h ving in
a cabin that was almost a replica of the mountain one except that it didnt situ pm the bright wind but s at instead beside
a big flat river that sometimes showed no current at all and even sometimes ran backward where his sisters and brothers seemed to take sick
after supper and die before the next meal where regiments of with white men wat di ing them planted and raised things that he had
never heard of the oldman did something besides drink now atleast he would leave the cab m after breakfast and return sober to supper and
he fed them somehow and the man was there who owned all the land and the and apparently the white men who superintended the work
and who lived indie biggest house he had ever seen and who spent most of the afternoon e told how he would creep up among
the tangled shrubbery of the lawn and ii u bidden and watch the manina barrel stave ham mod c between two trees with his shoes
off and anger who worn everyday better clothes than he or his the rand sisters had ever owned and ever expected to who did nothing
else but fin him and bring him drinks and he he was eleven or twelve or thirteen now because this was where he realized dm
the had irrevocably lost count of his age would he there all afternoon while the sisters would come from time to time to the door
of die cabin two miles away and scream at hit n for wood or water watching that man who not only had shoes in the
summertime too but didnt even have to wear them but he still didn to ivy the man he was watching he coveted the shoes and
probably be would have liked for his fit her to have a broadcloth monkey to hand him the jug and to carry the wood and
water into the cabin for his sisters to was hand cook with and keep the house warm so that he himself would not have to
do it maybe he even realized understood the pleasure k would have given his sisters for thr neighbors other whites like them who h ved
in other cabins not quite as well built and not at all as well kept and preserved as the ones the nger slaves h ved
in but still nimbus ed with freedoms bright aut a which the slave quarters were not for all their sound roof i and whitewash to
see them being waited on because he had not only not lost the k moca ice yeti he had not yet disc ovo that he
possessed k he no mote envied the man than he would have envied a mountain man who happened to own a fine rifle he would
have coveted the rifle but he wo idd himself have supported and confirmed the owners pi kle and pleasure in it so was is b
ipbe ci tose he coo u not have conceived of the owner tak k igm k crass advantage of the luck wh kh gave the
rifle to him zb rather than to another as to say to other men because i own this rif ie my arms and legs and
blood and bones are superior to yot irs except as the victorious outcome of a fight with rifles and how indie world could a man
fight another man with dressed up and the fact that he could lie in a hammock all afternoon with his shoes off and what in
the world would he he fighting to rif he did he didnt even know he was innocent that daywhen his father sent him to the
big house with the message he didnt remember or did not say what the message was apparently he still didnt know exactly just what his
father did or maybe was supposed to do what work the oldman had m relation to the plan tauon he was a boy either thirteen
or fourteen he didnt know which in garments his father had got from the plantation commissary and had worn out and which one of t
lie sisters had patched and cut down to fit him and he was no more conscious of his appearance in them or of the possibility
that anyone else would be than he was of his skin following the road and turning m to the gate and following t lie drive
up past where still more with nothing to do all day but plant flowers and trim grass were working and so to the house the
portico the front door thinking how atlas the was going to see the inside of it see what else a man was bound to own
who could have as pcd al to hand him his liquor and pull off his shoes that he didnt even need to wear never for
one moment thinking but what the man would be as pleased to show him the balance of his things as the mountain man would have
been to show the powder horn and bullet mold that went with the rifle because he was still innocent he knew it without being aware
that he did he told grandfather how before the monkey nger who came to the door had finished saying what he said he seemed to
kind of dissolve and apart of him turn and nid i bath rou g kt ke two years they had lived there like when you
pass through a room fast and look at all the objects in it andy on turn and go back through the room again and look
at all the obj a as from the other side and you find out you had never seen them before rushing back through those two
years and seeing a do kn things that had happened and he had nt even seen them before the certain flat level silent way his
older sisters and the od white women of their kind had of looking at nr s not with fear or dread but with a kind
of speculative antagonism not because of any known feet or reason but inherited by both white and bla dk the sense ef flu vi um
of it passing between the white women in the doors of the sagging cabins and the in the road and which was not quite explain
able by the fact that the agger s had better clothes and which the did not return as antagonism or in any sense of dare
or taunt but through the very feet that they were apparently oblivious of it too oblivious of it you knew di at you could hit
them he told grand fet her and they would not hit back or even resist but you did not want to because they the were
not it not what you wanted to hit that you knew when you hit them you would just be hitting adu lds toy balloon with
a free painted on it a feces lick and smooth and distended and about to burst into laughing and so you did not dare strike
it because it would merely burst and you would rather let it walk on out of your sight than to have stood there in the
load laughing he remembered talk at night before the fire wh tai they had company or had dte msl ves gone visiting after supper to
another cabin the voices of the women sober enough even calm yet filled with a quality dari c and sub en and only some man
usually his father in drink to breakout into harsh recapitulation of his own worth the reject which his own physical prowess commanded from his fellows
and the boy of either thirteen or fourteen or maybe twelve i mowing that the men and the women were talking about the same thing
though it had never once been mentioned by name as when people talk about privation without mentioning the siege about sickness without ever naming the
epidemic he remembered one afternoon when he and his sister were walking along the road and he heard the carnage coming up behind them and
stepped off the road and then realized that his sister was not going to give way to it that she still walked in the middle
of the road with a sort of sullen imp lac a bih ty in the very angle of her head and he shouted at her
and then it was all dust and rearing horses and gh ntu ig harness buckles and wheel spoke she saw two parasols m the carriage
and the coachman in a plug hat shout mg hood arg a lg it out ende way dar and then it was over gone the
carrie and the dust the two faces beneath the parasols glaring down a this sister then he was throw mg vain clods of dirt after
the dust as it spun on he knew now while the monkey dressed butler kept the door barred with his body while he spoke that
it had not been the coachman that he threw at at all that it was the actual dust raised by the proud delicate wheels and
just that vain he thought of one night late when his father came home blundered into the cabin he could s meet he whiskey even
while still dulled with broken sleep hearing that same fierce exultation vindication in his fet her s voice we wh upped one of pet tib
one sniggers tonight and hero used at di at waked at dia tasking which one of pet tib one sniggers and his father said he
did not know had never seen the before and he asked what die had done and his father said hellfire that god damson of a
bitch pet tib one snigger he must have meant the question the same way his fe her meant the answer without knowing it then since
he had not yet discovered innocence no actual nig get j living creature living flesh to feel pain and writhe and cr you the could
even seem to see them the to rdi disturbed darkness among trees the fierce hysterical faces of the white men the balloon face of the
maybe the hands would be tied or held but that would be all rh t because they were not the hands with which the balloon
face would struggle and writhe for freedom not the balloon face it was just poised among diem lev it at ive and slick with paper
thin distension then someone would strike the balloon one single desperate and despairing blow and then he would seem to see them fled ng running
with all about them overtaking them and passing and going on and then returning to overwhelm them again the roaring waves of mellow laughter meaningless
and terrifying and loud and now he stood there before that white door with the monkey barring it and looking down at him in his
patched made over jeans clothes and no shoes and i dont reckon he had even ever ex peri mm ted with acomb because that would
be one of the things that his sisters would keep hidden good he had never thought about his own hair or do the s or
anybody dse s hair or do the s until he saw that monkey who through no doing of his own happened to have h the
f di city of being house lu ed in richmond maybe looking or maybe even in charleston s hr eve breathed at them and he
never event em em he red what the said how it was the to h him eva i before he had had time to say
what he came for never to come to that fir on t door again but togo around to the bac l he didnt eve a
i remember leaving all of a sudden he found himself running and already some distance fi rom the house and not toward home he was
not cry id he said he wasnt even mad he just had to think so he was go ir to where he could be quiet
and think and he knew where that place was he went into the woods he says he did not tell himself where to gotha this
body his feet just went the rez place where a game trail entered a cane brake and an oak tree had fallen across it and
made a kind of cave where he kept an iron griddle that he would cook small game on sometimes he said he crawled back into
the cave and s at with his back against the up tom roots and thought because he couldnt get it straight ye the couldnt even
realize yet dia this trouble his impediment was innocence because he would not be able tore ak ze that until he got it straight so
he was seeking among what ht tle he had to call experience for something to measure it by and he couldnt find anything h fe
had been told togo around to the backdoor even before he could state his errand who had sprung from a people whose houses didnt have
back doors but only windows and anyone entering or leaving by a window would be either hid mg or escaping neither of which he was
doing in f the had actually come on business in the good faith of business which he had believed that all men accepted of course
he had not expected to be invited into eat a meal since time the distance from one cooking pot to the next did not need
to be measured in hours or days perhaps he had not expected to be asked into the house at all but he did expect to
be listened to because he had come been sent on some business which eventhough he didnt remember what it was and maybe at the time
he said he might not even have comprehended was certainly connected somehow with the plantation that supported and endured that smooth whitehouse and that smooth
white brass decorated door and the very broad doth and linen and silk stockings the monkey stood into tell him togo around to die back
before he could even state the bus iu ess it wash ke he might i mez been sent v ndia lump of lead or even
a few molded bullets so di at the man vs f ho owned die fine rifle could shoot it and the man came to the
door and told him to leave the bullets on a stump at the edge of the woods not even letting him come dose enough to
look at the rifle because he was not mad he in r is ted on that to grand then he was just thinking because he
knew that something would have to be done about i the would have to do something about it in order to live with himself for
the rest of his life and he could not decide what it was because of that innocence wh kh he had just discovered he had
which the innocence not the man the tradition he would have to compete with he had nothing to compare and gauge it by but die
rifle analogy and it would not make sense by that he was quite calm about i the said sitting there with his arms around his
knees in his litt kde n beside the game trail v die re more than once when the wind was right he had seen deer
pass within ten feet of him arguing with himself quietly and calmly while both debaters agreed that if there were only somme else some older
and smarter person to ask but there was not there vm only him sd fi the two of them inside that one body arguing quiet
and calm but i can mt him not the monkey nger it vm not the nir anymore than it had be m then that his
fet her had hdpe d to whip that night the nie r was just another balloon feces lick and distended with that mellow loud and
terrible laughing so that he did not dare to burst it looking down at him fi rom within the half i dosed door during that
instant in wh kh before he knew itv something in him had escaped and he una he to dose the eyes of it was looking
out fi rom within the balloon fiu x just as the man who did not even have to wear the shoes he owned whom the
laughter which the balloon hdd barricaded and protected fi rom such as he looked out from whatever invisible place he the man happened to beat
the moment at the boy outside the barred door in his patched garments and s played bare feet looking through and beyond the boy he
himself seeing his own father and sisters and brothers as the owner the rich man not the must have been seeing the mail the time
as cattle creatures heavy and without grace brat ely evacuated into a world without hope or purpose for them who would in turns pawn with
brutish and vicious prolixity populate double treble and compound fill space and earth with a race whose future would be a succession of cut down
and patched and made over garments boughton exorbitant credit because they were w li it e people from stores where were given the garments fire
e with for sole heritage that expression on a balloon face bursting with laughter which had looked out at some un remembered and nameless progenitor
who had knocked at a door when he was a little boy and had been told by amg ger togo around to the back but
i can si wot him he argued with himself and the other no that wouldnt do no good and the first what shall we do
then and the other i don th now and die first but i can shoot him i could slip right up there through them bushes
and lay there until he come out to lay in the hammock and shoot him and the other no that wouldnt do no good and
die first then what shall we do and die other i dont know now he was hungry it was before dinner when he went to
the big house and now there was no sun at all where he crouched though he could soil see sun in the tops of the
trees around him but his stomach had already told him it was late and that it would be later s tiu when he reached home
and then he said he began to think home home and that he thought at first that he was trying to laugh and that he
kept on telling him s dt fit was laughing even after he knew better home as he came out of the woods and approached it
st ifl hy dai yet and looked at it the rough par dy rot to i log walls the sagging roof whose missing shingles they
did not replace bat just set pans and buckets under the leaks die f can to room which they used for kitchen and which was
all right b use in good weather it didnt even matter that it had no chimney since they did not attempt to use it at
all when i trained and his sbt er pumping rhythmic up and down above a washtub in the yard herba toward hi shapeless in a
calico dress and a pair of the oldman s shoes unlaced and flapping about herb are ankles and broad in the beam as a cow
the very labor she was doing brutish and stupidly out of afl proportion to its reward the very primary essence of labor to ik reduced
to its crude absolute which only a beast could and would endure and nowe said the thought striking him for the first time as to
what he would tell his fiu her when the oldman asked him if he had delivered the messe whether he would lie or not since
if he did lie he would bef ii und out maybe at once since probably the man had already sent a down to see why
whatever it was his th a had il to do was not done and had smt the c accuse f intan ted that that was
what his errand to the house had been wh idi granted his oldman it pro bah fy was but it didnt happen at once because
his the r was not at home yet so it was only the sister as if she had been waiting not for the wood but
just for b into return fi ir die opportunity to use her vocal cord snagging at him to fetch the wood and he not mfi
ising not objecting just not heating her paying any attention to her because be was still tbm king him the oldman came and the ri
ster told on him and the oldman made him fetch the wood and sri uno di ing said about the errand while die yates t
per nor when he wert t and lay down on the pallet where he t and where he went to bed by just lying down
only not to sleep now just lying there within s hands under his head and still nothing said about it and he still not knowing
if he was going to lie or not because he said to grandfather the tern ble part of it had not occurred to him ye
the just lay there while the two of them argued inside of him speaking in orderly turn both calm even leaning backward to becalm and
reasonable and un rancorous btu i can kill himno that wouldnt do no good then what shall we do ah out it i dont know
and he just listening note spec i a ey interested he said hearing the two of them without listening because what he was thinking about
now he hadn tasked for it was just there natural in a boy a child and he not paying any attention to it either because
it was what a boy would have thought and he knew that to do what he had to do in order to live with himself
he would have to think it out stra ht a saman would thinking the never give me a chance to tell him what it was
and so he not the now either wont know it and w lt at ever it is wont get done and he wont know it
a in td one until too late so he will get paid back that much for what he sett it at to do and if
it only was to tell him that the st td j le the house was on fire and die wouldnt even let me tell him
warn him and then he said that all of a sudden it was not thinking it was something shouting it almost loud enough for his
sisters on the other pallet and his father in the bed with the two youngest and filling the room with alcohol snoring to hear too
he never even give me a chance to say it it to of ost to on aix ed up to bethinking it all kind of
shouting at him at once boiling out and over him like the nger laughing he never give me a chance to say it and pap
never asked me if it old him or not and so he cant even know that pap sent j a many message and so whether
he got it or not emit even matter not even to papi went up to that door for that to tell me never to come
to that front door agm n and not only wasnt doing my good to him by telling it or my harm to him by not
tell ii it there a in t any good or harm either in the living world that i can do to mm it was like
that he said like a sex plo a on a bright glare that vanished and left nothing no ashes nor refuse just a limitless flat
plain with the severe shape of his intact innocence rising from it like a monument fli at innocence instructing him as calm as the others
had ever spoken using his own rifle analogy to do it with and when it said them in place of he or him it meant
more than all the human puny mortals under the sun that might lie in hammocks all afternoon with their shoes off he thought if you
were fixing to combat them that had the fine rifles the first thing you would do would be to get yourself the nearest thing to
a fine rifle you could borrow or steal or make wouldnt it j and he said yes but this a in ta question of rifles
so to combat them you have got to have what they have that made them do what the man did you got to have land
and ngers and a fine house to combat them with you see and he said yes again he k ft that night he waked before
day and departed just like he went to bed by rising from the pallet and tiptoeing out of the house he never saw any of
his f run ilya gain he went to the west indies que nr in had not moved not even to raise his head from its
at t it a de of brood ir bemuse ment upon the open letter wh idi lay on the open textbook his hands lying on
the table before him on either side of the book and foe letter one half of which slanted upward from foe transverse crease without support
as if it had learned half foe secret of levitation that was how s ut pen said i the and grand fr the r were
sitting on a log now bec auf fi foe dogs had fruited that is they had tree dz tree from which he foe architect could
not have escaped yet which he had rm doubted ly mounted because they found foe sapling pole with his suspenders sti il knotted about one
end of it that he had used to climb the tree though at first they could not understand why the suspenders and it was three
hours before they comprehended that the architect had used architecture physics to elude them a saman always falls backup on what he knows best in
a crisis the murderer upon murder the thief thieving the liar lying he the architect knew about the wild even if he couldnt have known
that s ut pen would get dogs he had chosen that tree and hauled that pole up after him and calculated stress and distance and
trajectory and had crossed a gap to the next nearest tree that a flying squirrel could not have crossed and traveled from there on from
tree to tree for almost half a in ile before he put foot on the ground again it was three hours before one of the
wild the dogs wouldnt leave the tree they said he was in it found where he had comedown so he and grandfathers at on the
log and talked and one of the wild went back to camp for grub and i he rest of the whiskey and they blew the
other men in with horns and the yate and he told grandfather some more cd it while they waited he went to the west indies
that shows ut pen said it not how he managed to find where the west indies were nor where ships departed from togo there nor
how he got to where the ships were and got in one nor how he liked these an or about the hardships of a sailors
life and it must have been hardship indeed for him a boy of fourteen or fifteen who had never seen the ocean before going to
sea in he just said so i went to the west indies sitting there on the log with grandfather while the dogs still bayed the
dree where they believed the architect was because he would have to be there saying it just like that day thirty years later when he
satin grandfathers office in his fine clothes now even thou g k they were a little soiled and worn with three years of war with
money to rat de in his pocket and his beard at its prime too beard body and intellect at that peak which all the different
parts that make a man reach where he can say i did all that is et out to do and i could stop here if
i wanted to aid no man to chide me with sloth not even myself and maybe this the instant which fate always picks out to
black jati you only the peak feels so sound and stable that l he beginning of the failing is hidden for a little while saying
it with his head flung up a little in that attitude that nobody ever knew exactly who he had aped it from or if he
did not perhaps le amit too from the same book out of which he taught himself the words the bombastic phrases with which grandfather said
he ev or asked you fr ra match for his d gar or offered you the cigar and foe re was nothing of vanity nothing
comic in it either grandfather said because of that innocence which he had never lost because after it finally told him what to do that
night he forgot about it and didnt know that he still had it and he told grand f other told him mind not excusing asking
for no pity not explaining asking for no ex culp ation just told grand fr the r how he had put his first wife aside
liked event hand t wdf th coi to ty kings did found that she was not and could never be through no fruit of her
own adjunct ive or incremental to the design which i had in nhn dso provided for her and put her aide telling grand fr the
r in that same tone while they s at on die log waiting for the nig gos to comeback with the of r ter guests
and the whiskey so i went to the west indies i had had some x hoo lix during apart of one winter enough to have
learned something about them to realize that they would be most suitable to the expediency of my re qu fremen t she didnt remo m
ber how he came togo to the school lh at is why his fr the rde dd ql all ca sodden to send mm what
nebulous vision or shape might have evolved out of the fog of alcohol and beating and scheming to avoid work vm ch his oldman called
his mind the image not of ambition nor glory not to seems son better himself forms own sake probably not even some blind instant of
revolt against that same house whose roof had leaked on probably a hundred families hk ems wm ch had come and lived beneath it and
vanished and left not race nothing not even rags and broken crockery hut was probably mere tin dk ti ve envy toward one or two
men planters whom he had to see every now and then anyway he was sent to school for about three months one winter an adolescent
boy of thirteen or fourteen in a room full of children three or four years younger than he and dh ree or four years further
advanced and he not only probably bigger than the tear die r the kind of tea d her that would be teaching a one room
country school inanest of tidewater plantations but a good deal more of a man who probably brought into the school with him along with ms
sober watchful mountain reserve a good deal of latent insubordination dia the would not be aware of anymore than he would he aware at first
that the teacher was afi md of mm it would not be in tract a rh u hy and maybe you couldnt call it pride
either but maybe just these l fire ii ance of mountains and solitude since some of ms blood atleast ns mother was a mountain woman
a scotty i woman who so he told grand faf bern ever did quite le am to speak english had been bred in mountains but
wm ch whatever it was was that wm ch forbade mm to condescend to memorize dry sums and such but which did permit mm to
listen when df fi teacher read alc tad sent to sch hee he told grand fa the iii learned little saveh most of the eds
good and had both incurring op pro brit an carp ted i is or reward either within the scope of mans abilities bad already been
performed and were to be learned about only from books so i listened w l he would read to u siret liz e now that
on mc t of these occasions he resorted to reading aloud only when he saw that the moment had come when his entire school was
on die point of rising and leaving the room but whatever the reason he read to us and i anyway listened thou i did not
know that in that listening i was equipping myself better for what i should later design to dot hanifi had learned all the addition and
subtraction in the book that was how i learned of the west indies not where they were though if i had known at die time
that that knowledge would someday serve mei would have learned that too what i learned was that there was a place called the west indies
to which poor men went in ships and became rich it didnt matter how so long as that man was clever and courageous the latter
of which i believed that i possessed the former of which i believed that if it were to be learned by energy and will in
the sdio olof endeavor and experience i should le ami remember how remained one af remo on when school was out and waited for the
teacher waylaid him he was a small ishman who always looked dusty as if he had been bom and lived all his h fo in
attics and storerooms i recall how he started back when he saw me and how i thought at the time that if i were to
strike him there would he no resulting outcry but merely the sound of the blow and a puff of dustin the air as when you
strike a rug hanging from a line i asked him if it were true if what he had read us about the men who got
rich in the west indies were true why no the answered starting bade didnt you he arme read it from the book how doi know
that what you read was in the book is aidi was that gim i that countrified you see i had not then learned to read
my own name although i had been attending the school for almost tiu ee months id are say i knew no more than i did
when i entered the schoolroom for the first time but i had to know you see perhaps a man builds for his future in more
ways than one builds not only toward the body which will be his tomorrow or next year but toward actions and the subsequent irrevocable courses
of resultant action which his weak senses and intellect cannot foresee but which tenor twenty or thirty years from now he will take will have
to take in order to survive the act perhaps it was that instinct and not i who grasped one of his arms as he drew
back i did not actually doubt him i think that even then even at my age i realized that he could not have invented it
that he lacked that something which is necessary in a man to enable him to fool even ad ii ld by lying but you see
i had to be sure had to take whatever method that came to my hand to make sure and there was nothing else to hand
except him glaring at me and beginning to struggle and i hold high im and saying i was quite calm quite calm i just had
to know saying suppose i went there and found out that it was not so and he shrieking now di outing help help so that
i let him go so when the time came when i real it md that to accomplish my design i should need first of all
and above all thin money inconsiderable quantities and in the quite immediate future remembered what he had read to us and i went to the
west indies then the other guests began to ride up and after a while the came back with the coffeepot and a deer haunch and
the whiskey and one bot de of ham p ne which they bad overlooked grand the r said and s ut pen stopped talk mg
for a while he didnt tdl anymore of it until they had eaten and were sitting around smoking while the and the dogs made cns
ts in all dire ch on s they had to drag he dogs away fi rom he tree but especially away f iom he sap
b ng pole wi di the architects suspenders tied to it as if it was not only that the pole was the last thing the
ard hit ect had touched but it was the thing his exultation had touched wha i he saw another chance to dude them and so
it was not only the man but the exultation too which the dogs smelled that made them wild the and the dogs were getting further
and firth era way until just before sundown one of the e whooped and he he had nt spoken for sometime grand fe th cr
said lying there on one elbow in the fine boots and the only pants he had and the shirt he had put on when he
came out of the mud and washed himself off after he realized that he would have to hunt the architect down himself if he wanted
him back alive probably not talking himself and maybe not even listening while the men talked about cotton and politics just smoking the cigar grand
fet her li ad given him and looking at the fire embers and maybe making that west indian voyage again that he had made when
he was fourteen and didnt even know where he was going or if he would ever get there or not no more way of knowing
whether the max who said the ship was going there were lyi i or not than he had of knowing w diet her or not
the schoolteacher was telling the trud i about what was in the book and he never told whether the voyage was hard or not how
much he must have had to endure to make it but then he believed that all that was ne ex s s ary was courage
and shrewdness and the one he knew he had and tte other he believed he could learn if it were to be taught and it
probably was the hardship of the voyage which comforted him and that the men who said the sp was ing to the west indies had
not lied to him became at that dm grandfather said be probably could not have believed in anything tl was easy he there it is
and got up and they aft went on and und where the architect had coin e back fx the ground d di again with again
of almost three hours so they had to gc fast now and there wasnt much time to talk or atleast grandfather said he did not
appear to intend to resume then the sun went down and the other men had to start hack to town they all went except grandfather
because he wanted to listen some more so he sent word in by one of the other she was not married the neither that he
would not be home and he and s ut pen went on tin til the light felled two of the they were thirteen miles from
s ut pens camp then had already gone back to get blankets and more grub then it was dark and the began to light pine
knots and they went on foral it de while yet gain it ig what they could now since they knew that the architect would have
had to denso on after dark to keep from traveling in a circle that was how grandfather remembered i the and s ut pen leading
their horses he would look back now and then and see the horses eyes shining in the torch li and the horses heads tossing and
the shadows slipping along their should os and flanks and the dogs and the the mostly s dll naked except f trap air of pants
here and there with the pine torches smoking and flaring above them and the red lh ton their roundheads and arms and the mud they
wore in the swamp to keep the mosquitoes off dried hard and shiny glinting like glass or china and the shadows they cast taller than
they were at one moment then gone the next and even the trees and brake and thickets there one tno ment and gone the next
though you knew all the time th af they were still there because you could feel them with your breathing as though invisible the ypres
ed down and condensed the invisible air you breathed and he said how s ut pen was talking about it again telling bim again before
he realized that this was some more of it and he said how he thoth t there was something about a mans destiny or about
the man that caused the destiny to shape itself to him like his do the s did like the same coat that new might have
fitted a thousand men yet after one man has worn it for aw hfl e it fits noone else and you can tell it anywhere
you see it even if all you see is a sleeve or a lapel so that his the demons s hr eve said destiny had
fitted itself to him to his innocence his pristine aptitude for platform drama and childlike heroics imp lid ty just as the fine broad d
of h uniform which you could have seen on ten thousand men during those four years which he wore when he came in the office
on that afternoon thirty years later had fitted itself to the swaggering of all his gestures and to the forensic verbiage in which he stated
calmly with that frank innocence which we call of a child except that a human child is the only living creature that is never either
fi rank or innocent the most simple and the most outrageous things he was t dling some more of it was already into what he
was telling yet still without telling how he got to where he was nor even how what he was now involved in came too amr
he was obviously at ira st twenty years old at the time he was telling about crouching behind a window in the dark and firing
the muskets through it wh idi someone else loaded and handed to him getting himself and grand f other both into that besieged j eia
it ian room as simply as he got him s df to the west indies by saying that he decided togo to the west indies
and so he went there this anecdote was no deliberate continuation of the other one but was mer dy called to his mind by the
picture of the and torches in fir on toft ii em he not telling how he got there what had happened during the six years
between that daywhen he had decided togo to the west hid tes and become ruh and this night who i overseer or foreman or something
to a french sugar planter he was barricade in the bo use with foe planters fo mily and now grandfather said there was the first
mention a shadow that almost emerged for a moment and then faded again but not completely away of the its a girls hr eve said
dont tell me just goon woman whom he was to tell grandfather thirty years afterward he had found unsuitable to his purpose and so put
aside though providing for her and there were a few frightened half breed servants with them who he would have to turn from the window
from time to time and kick and curse into helping fi be girl load the muskets which he and the planter fired through the windows
and i reckon grandfather was saying wait wait for gods sake wait about like you are until he finally did stop and backup and start
over again with atleast some regard for cause and e ffe a even if none for logical sequence and continuity or maybe it was the
fact that they were sitting again now having decided that they had gone br enough for that night and the ngers had made camp and
cooked supper and they he and grandfather drank some of the whiskey an date and then s at before the fire drinking some more of
the whiskey and he idling it all over and still it was not absolutely dear the how and the why he was there and what
he was since he was not talking about himself he waste hio ga story he was not bragging about something he had done j he
was just td linga story about something a man named thomas s ut pen had experienced which would still have been the same story if
the man had had no name at all if it had been to u about any manor no man over whiskey at night that may
have bear what slowed him down but it was not enough to clarify the story m ucl he still was not recounting to grandfather the
career of somebody named thomas s utp escu grandfather said the only mention he ever to those six or seven yar s which must have
existed somewhere must have actually occurred was about lie patois he hz d to learn in order to oversee the plantation and die french he
had to kara maybe not to get engaged to be married but which he ou ld certainly need to be able to repudiate die wife
after he had already g other how so he told grandfather heh atl believed that courage and shrewdness would be enough but found that he
was wrong and how sorry he was that he had not taken the schooling ng with the west indian lore vr hen he discovered that
all people did not speak the same tongue and realized that he would not only need courage and skill he would have to i cam
to speak a new language ele that design to which he had dedicated himself would die still bom so he learned the language just like
he learned to be a sailor i reckon because grant fiat her a deed him why he didnt get himself a girl to live with
and learn it the easy way and grandfather said how he s at there with the fire hgb ton his face and the beard and
b is eyes quiet and sort of bright and said and grandfather said it was the only ome he ever knew him to say anything
quiet and simple on this night iam speaking of and until my first marriage i might add i was still a virgin you will probably
not believe that and if i were to try to explain it you would disbelieve me more than ever so i will oid y say
that that too was apart of the des n which i had in my mind and grand fet her said why shouldnt i believe it
t and he looking at grandfather still with that quiet bright expression about the ey s saying but do you s surely you dont hold
mein such small contempt as to believe that at twenty i could neith ar have suffered temptation nor offered it and grandfather said you re
right i shouldnt believe it but ida so it was not afc about women and certainly not about love they iman the girl just that
shadow which could load a musket but could not ii a vc been trusted to fire c me out the window tli at nig lit
or the seven or eight nights w li ile they hud dk d indie dark and watched from the windows the bam s or granaries
or whatever it is you harvest sugar into and the fields too blazing and s mo lang he said how you could smell it you
could smell nothing else the rank sweet rich smell as if the hatred and the imp lac a bih ty the thousand secret dark years
which had created the hatred and implacability had intensified the smell of the sugar and grandfather said how he remembered then that he had seen
s ut pen each time decline sugar for his coffee and so he grandfather knew why now but he asked anyway to be sure and
s ut pen told him it was true that he had not been afraid until after the fields and bam s were all burned and
they had even forgot about the smell of the burning sugar but that he had never been able to bear sugar since the girl just
emerging for a second of the telling in a single word almost so that grand fet her said it was like he had just seen
her to of or a second by the flash of one of the muskets z bent face a single ched kachi n for an instant
beyond a curtain off len hair a whites laid er arm raised add he ate hand clutching a ramrod and that was all no more
detail and information about that than about how he got fi rom the field his overseeing into the besieged house when the rushed at him
with their machetes than how he got from the rotting cabin in virginia to the fields he oversaw and this grandfather said was more incredible
to him than the getting there from virginia because that did infer time a space the getting across which did indicate something of leisu rdi
ness since time is longer t bati any distance while the other the getting from the fid ds into the barricaded house seemed to have
occurred with a sort of violent abrogation which must have been almost as short as his telling about it a very condensation of time winch
was the gauge of its own violence and he telling it in tii at pleasant faintly forensic anecdotal manner apparently just as here mem her
edit was impressed byu through detached and impersonal interest and curiosity which even fear that once when he mentioned fear by that same inverse process
of speaking of a time when he was not a aid before he became afraid he put it failed to leaven very much because he
was not afraid until after it was all over grandfather said because that was all it was to him z spectacle something to be watched
because he might not have a chance to see it again since his innocence still functioned and he not only did not know what fear
was until afterward he did not even know that at first he was not te jr nf icd did not even know that he had
found the place where money was to be had quick if you were courageous and shrewd he did not mean shrewdness grand fet her said
what he meant was unscrupulousness only he didnt know that word because it would not have been in the book from which the schoolteacher read
or maybe that was what he meant by courage grandfather said but where high mortality was concomitant with the money and the shon on the
dollars was not from gold but from blood z spot of earth which might have been created and set aside by heaven itself grandfather said
as a theater for violence and injustice and bloodshed and all the satanic lusk of human greed and cruelty for the last despairing fury of
all the pariah interdict and all the doomed z little island set in a smiling and fury lurked and incredible indigo sea which was the
halfway point between what we call the jungle and what we call civilization halfway between the dark inscrutable continent from wm ch the black blood
the black bones and fie shand thinking and remember and hopes and desires was raw shed by viola ice and the cold la a own
land to which it was doomed the civilized land and people which had expelled some of its own blood and a so thinking and desires
di at had become too crass to be faced and borne longer and set it homeless and desperate on the lonely ocean a little lest
island in a latitude which would require ten thousand years of equatorial heritage to bear its climate a soil manured with black blood from two
hundred years of oppression and exploitation until it sprang with an incredible paradox of peaceful greenery and crimson flowers and sugarcane sapling size and three
times the height of a man and al it de bulkier of course but valuable pound for pound almost with silver ore as if nature
held a balance and kept a book and of ie red a recompense for the tom limbs and outraged heart seven if man did not
the planting of nature and man too watered not only by the wasted blood but breathed over by the winds in which the doomed ships
had fled in vain out of which the last tatter of sail had sunk into the blue sea along which the last vain despairing cry
of woman or child had blown away the planting of men too the yet intact bones and brains in which the old un sleeping blood
that had vanished into the earth they trod still cried out for vengeance and he overseeing it riding peacefully about on his horse while he
learned the language du t meager and fragile thread grandfather said by which the little surface comers and edges of mens secret and so ht
ary lives maybe joined for an instant now and then before sio king back into the darkness where the spirit cried for the first time
and was not heard and will cry for the last time and wdl i not be heard th mdt her not knowing that what he
rode upon was a volcano hearing the air tremble and throb at flight with the drums and the chanting and not know d ng that
it was the heart of the earth itself he heard who believed grandfather said that earth was kind and gentle and that dar lm wt
s was merely something you saw or could not see in ove i seeing what he oversaw and not knowing that he was ow kc
eing it rna king his daily expeditions from an armed citadel until the day itself came and he not telling that either how that day
happened the st qs leading up to it because grand fat lier said he appa rend y did not know aom pre he nd what
he must have been seeing everyday because of that innocence z pigs bone with a little rotten flesh still dinging to it a few chicken
feathers a stained dirty rag with a few pebbles tied up in it found on the oldman s pillow one morning and none knew least
of afl the planter himself who had been asleep on the pillow how it had come there because mey learned at the sametime that all
the servants the half breeds were missing and he did not know until the planter told him that the stains on the rag were neither
dirt nor grease but blood north at what he took to be the planters gallic rage was actually fear terror and he just curious and
quite interested because he s tiu looked upon the planter and die daughter both as foreigners he told grandfather how until that first night of
the siege he had not once thought that he did not know the girls christian name whether he had ever heard it or no the
also told grandfather dropped this into the telling as you might fli dt the joker out of a pad c of fresh cards without being
able to remember later whether you had removed the joker or not that the oldman s wife had been a spaniard and so it was
grandfather and not s ut pen who realized that until that first night of the attack he had possibly not seen the girl as much
as a dozen times the body of one of the half breeds was found at lasts ut pen fo md it hunted for it for
two days without even knowing di at what he was meeting was a blank wall of black secret feces a wall behind which almost anything
co tfl dbe preparing to happen and as he learned la tar almost anything was and m the third day he found the body where
he could not pos s ihl y have miss it during the first hour of the first day z sz if it had been there
ah the time he was speaking he was sitting on the log grand fa die r said telling it making the gestures to tell it
with the man grandfather himself had seen fight naked chest to chest with one of his wild rug gers by the light of the campfire
while his house was building and who sdl fought with them by lantern ht in the stable after he had got at last that wife
who would be adjunct ive to the forwarding of that design he had in mind and no bones made about the fighting either no hands
hal c ing and gr atul at ions while he washed the blood off and donned his shirt because at the end of it the
would be flat on his back with his chest heaving and another throwing water on him he was sitting there on the log telling grandfather
how atlas the fbi md the half breed or what used to be the half breed and so began to comp rd he nd that
the situation might become serious then the house the barricade the five of them the planter the daughter two women servants and himself shut up
in it and sie air filled with the s mn lr ft and smell of burning cane and the glare and smoke of it on
the sky and the air throbbing and trembling with the drums and the chanting the little lost island beneath its down cupped bowl of alternating
day and night like a vacuum into wh no help could come where not even wind sfio m the outer world tame but only the
trade sae same weary winds blowing back and forth across it and burdened still with the weary voices of murder a i women and chi
id ren hom c less and grave less about the isolating and solitary sea while a e two servants and the girl whose christian name
he did not yet know loaded the muskets which he and the father fired at no enemy but a tae haiti e an night itself
lancing a eir lit deva in and puny flashes into a e brooding and blood r weary and throbbing darkness and it a everytime of
year a e season between hurricanes and any hope of rain and he told how cm li ie eight ii night tie water gave out
and something had to be done so he put tie musket down and went out and subdued them that was how he told i the
went out and subdued them and when he returned he and the girl became engaged to marry and grandfather saying wait wait sure enough now
saying but you didnt even know her you told med m when the siege began you didnt even know her name and he looked at
grandfather and said yes but you see it took me sometime to recover not how he didi the didnt teeth at either that of no
moment to the story either he just put the musket down and had someone unbar the hs or and then bar it behind him and
walked out into the dari cn css and subdued them maybe by yelling louder maybe by standing bearing more than they believed any bones and
flesh could or should should yes that would be the tem ble thing to find flesh to stand more than flesh should be asked to
stand maybe at last they themselves turning in horror and fleeing fi rom the white arms and legs shaped like their s and from which
blood could be made tour t and flow as it could fi rom the in and containing an indomitable spirit which should have come from
the same primary fire which their s came from but which could not have could not possibly have he showed grandfather the scars one of
which grandfather said came pretty near leaving him that virgin for the rest of his life too and then daylight came with no drums in
it for the first time in eight days and they emerged probably the man and the daughter and walked across the burned land with the
br ht sun shining down on it as if nothing had happened walking now in what must have been an in a edible desolate solitude
and peaceful quiet and found him and bro it him to the house and when he recovered he and the girl were enga goi then
stopped mae rights hr eve said goon i said he stopped quentin said i heard you stopped what how got engaged and then stopped yet
still had a wife to repudiate later you said he didnt remember how he got to haiti and then he didnt remember how he got
into the house with the surrounding it now are you going to tell me he didnt even remember getting married that he got engaged and
d ben he decided he would stop only one day he found out he had nt stopped but on the contrary he was married and
all you called him was just avi r gia he stopped tal h ing telling it quentin said he had not moved tall dn gap
par end y if to anything to the letter lying on the open book on the table between ids hands opposite him s hr eve
had filled the pipe and smoked it out gg at n it lay again overturned a scattering of white ashes fanning out fi rom the
bowl on to the u ble bd fore his crossed naked arms with which he appeared at the sametime both to support and hug himself
since although it was only eleven o dock the room was beginning to cool toward that point what about midnight there would be only enough
heat indie radiators to keep the pipes from freezing though he would not perform his deep breathing in the open window tonight at all he
had yet togo to the bedroom and return first with his bathrobe on and ne ict with his overcoat on top of the bathrobe and
quentin s overcoat on his arm he just said that he was now engaged to be married quentin said and then he stopped telling i
the just stopped grandfather said flat and final like that like that was dl there was all there could be to it all of it
that made good listening from one man to another over whiskey at n ibt maybe it was he quentin s face vr as lowered he
spoke still m that curious that almost sullen flatt one which had caused sh re veto as swatch him from the beginning with intent ck
t ached speculation and curiosity to watch him still from behind his s hr eves expression of cherubic and erudite amazement which the spectacles intensified
or perhaps actually created s ut pen just got up and looked at the whiskey bot de and said no more tonight well get to
sleep we want to get a nearly start tomorrow maybe we can catch him before he limbers up but they didnt it was late afternoon
before they caught him the architect i mean and then only because he had hurt iii skg trying to architect himself across the river but
he made a mistake in the calculation this time so the dogs and the bayed him and the nig gen making the racket no was
they hauled him out grandfather said how maybe the believed that by fleeing the architect had voluntarily surrendered his status as interdict meat had voluntarily
tiered the gambit by fleeing which the had accepted by chasing him and won by catching him and that now they would be allowed to
cook and cat him both victors and vanquished accepting this in the same spirit of sport and sportsmanship and no rancor or hard feelings on
either side all the men who had started the race yesterday had come bade except three and the ones that returned had brought others so
there were more of them now than when the race started grandfather said so they hauled him out of his cave under the riverbank a
little man with one sleeve missing from his froth coat and his flowered vest ruined by water and mud where be had fallen in the
river and one pants le gripped down so they could sec where he had tied up his leg with a pie c of his shirttail
and the rag b body and kg swollen and his hat was completely gone i hey sever did find it so grandfather gave him a
ne what the day he k fr who a the house was finished it was in grand the rs office and grandfather said the arch
it ca took the ne what and looked at it and burst into tears a little harried wild fec ed man with a two days
stubble of beard who came out of the cave fighting like a wildcat hurt leg and all with the dogs barking and the iv hoo
i ing and hollering with deadly and merry anti dp arion like they were under te impression that since the race had lasted more thant
went j four hours the rules would be automatically abrogated and they would not have to wait to cook him until s ut pen waded
in with a short stick and beat and dogs away leaving the architect standing there not scared worth adam neither just panting a little and
grandfather said a little sick in the face where the had mishandled his leg in the heat of the capture and making them a speech
in french along one and so fast that grandfather said probably another ren ch man could not have understood all of it but it sounded
fine grandfather said even he all of them could tell that the arch it ert was not apologizing it was fine grand fet her said
and he said how s ut pen turned toward him but he grandfather was already approaching the architect hold mg out the bottle of whiskey
already uncorked and grandfather saw the eyes in the gaunt face the eyes desperate and hopeless but indomitable too invincible too not beaten yet by
a damn right grandfather said and all that fifty odd hours of dark and swamp and rie ep less ness and fatigue and no grub
and nowhere togo and no hope of getting there just a will to endure and a fore knowing of defeat but not beat yet by
a damn sight and he took the bottle in one of his he dirty coon like hands and raised the other hand and even fumbled
about his head for a second before here man be red that the hat was gone then flung the hand up in a gesture that
grandfather said you simply could not describe that seemed to gather au misfortune and defeat that the h tim an race ever suffered into al
it de pinch in his fingers hk edu stand fling it backward over his head and raised the bottle and bowed first to grandfather thai
to all ak other men sitting their horses in a circle and looking at him and then he took not only the first drink of
neat whiskey he ever took in his life but the drink of it dia the could no more have conceived himself taking than the brahmin
can believe that that situation can conceivably arise in which he will eat dog quentin ceased at once s hr eve said all right dont
bother to say he stop d talking now just goon but quentin did not continue at once the flat curiously dead voice the downcast face
the relaxed body not stirring except to breathe the two of them not moving except to breathe both young both bom within the same year

never la il eyes on c mean other yet who since had dept in the same room and eaten side by side of the same

another across the km pl it table on which lay the fin gf le pandora s box of scrawled paper which had filled with violent
and uni a tio d native djinns and demons the sq ug monastic co ign this dreamy and head ess alcove of what we call
the best of tho og ht bothers hr eve said just get on wi di it that would take thirty years quentin s a icl
tt was thirty yea xs before su q jea told grandfather anymore of it maybe he was too busy all his time for spare talking
taken up wi dh furthering that design which he had in mind and his only relaxation fighting his wild in the stab k where the
men could hitch their horses and come up fi rom the back and not be seen from the house because he was already married now
his house finished and he already arrested for stealing it and freed again so that was all settled with a wife and two children no
three ink and his land dear a land planted with the seed grandfather loaned him and ht tn getting rich good and steady now yes
s hr eve said mr coldfield what was that i dont know quentin said nobody ever did know for certain it was something about a
bill of lading some way he persuaded mr coldfield to use his credit one of those rhin gs that when they work you were smart
and when they dont you change your name and move to t etc as and father said how mr coldfield must have s at back
there in his little store and watched his wagon load of stock double maybe every ten ye an s or atleast not lose any ground
and seen the chance to do that very same thing all the time only his conscience not his courage father said he had plenty of
that wouldnt let him then s ut pen came along and of ie red to doi the and mr coldfield to vi de the loot
if it worked and he s ut pen total mall the blame if it didnt and mr cold f if tld let hi meer said
it was because mr coldfield did no the lf eve it would work that they would get amy with it only he couldnt quit thinking
about it and so when they tried it and it failed he mr coldfield would be able to get it out of his mind then
and that when it did feu and they woe caught mr cold fid d wotm insist on taking his di are the blame as poi
ance andes pi ation for ha vic tinned in his mind all s it ke years because mr cold f ii el d never did
believe it would work so when he saw that it was going to work had worked the least thing he could do was to refuse
to take his share of the profits that when he saw that it had worked it was his conscience he hated not s utp a
i his conscience and the land the country which had created his conscience and then offered the opportunity to have made all that money to
the cons cie no e which it had created which could do nothing but decline hated that country so much that he was even glad
when he saw it drifting closer and closer to a doomed and fatal war that he would have joined the yankee army father said only
he was not a soldier and knew that he would either be killed or die of hardship and so he would not be present on
that daywhen the south would realize that it was now paying the price for having erected its economic edifice not on the rock of stem
morality but on the shifting sands of opportunism and moral brigand so he chose the only gesture he could think of to impress his disapproval
on these who should ou dive the fighting and so participate in the remorse sores hr eve said that s fine butsu tpi en the
der ign get m now yes quentin said the design g df ing richer and richer it most have looked fine and dear ahead for
him now house finished and even biggar and whiter than the one he had gone to the door of that day and the came in
his monkey do the s and told him togo to the bai i and he with his own brand of eva i which the man
who lay in t lk hammock with his shoes off didnt have to cull one fico m and train him togo to the door when
his turn cams ra little boy without any shoes on and with hs paps cut down pants for do the s to x me and
kno dk on it only father said that that wasnt it now that wb rai he to gia i ui her s office that day
afi ec the thirty yeses and not sn so trying to excuse now anymore than he had tried in the bottom that night when they
ran the architect but just to explain now trying hard to explain now because now he was old and knew it knew it was being
old that he had to talk against time shortening ahead of him that could and would do things to his chances and pos sibi h
ties even if he had no more doubt of his bones and flesh than he did of his will and courage telling grand fad her
that the boy symbol at the door wasnt it because the boy symbol was just the figment of the amazed and desperate child that now
he would take that boy in where he would never again need to stand on the outside of a white door and knock at it
and not at all for mete shelter but so that that boy that whatever nameless stranger could shut that door himself forever behind him on
all that he had ever known and look ahead along the still und i vue dh trays in which his descendants who t night not
even ever hear his the boys name waited to be bom without even having to know li at they had once been riven forever free
from brute hood just as his owns ut pens children were dont say its just me that sounds like your oldman s hr eve said
but goons ut pens di il dre ngo on yes quentin said the two children thinking yes maybe we are both f to her maybe
nothing ever happens once and is finished maybe happen is never once but like ripples maybe on water after the pebble sinks the ripples moving
on spreading the pool attached by a narrow umbilical water cord to the next pool which t lw first pool feeds has fed did feed

a different tone the infinite it fu hanging sky it doesnt matter that pebbles watery echo whose fall it did not even see moves across
its surface too at the original rik sparx to the ou mera dk able rhythm thinking yes we are di hath father or may he
father and i are both s kr eve maybe it took fiu ker and me both to makes hr eve or s hr eae and
me both to make father or maybe thomas s ut pen to tna ke all of us yes die two children the son and the
daughter by sex and age so ghb to the design that he might have planned that too by character mental and physical so glib to
it that he might have culled them out of the celestial herd of seraphs and die rub im like he chose his twenty out of
vh at ever swapping there must have been when he repudiated di at first e and that child when he discovered i hat they would
not be ac unc rive to the forwarding of the design and grandfather said there was no conscience about that that s ut pens at
indie office that afternoon after thirty years and told him how his cons do ice had bothered him somewhat at first but that he had
argued calmly and logically with his cons da ice until it was set ded just s she must have argued with his conscience about his
and mr coldfield s bill of lad ii only probably not as long here since time he m would pre sing until that was settled
how he granted that by certain htst here was injustice in what he did but that he had obviated that as much as lay in
his power by being aboveboard in the matter that he could have simply feer tal her could have taken his hat and walked out but
he did not and that he had what grand the r would have to admit was a good and valid d aim if not to
the whole place which he alone had saved as wdl as the lives of all the white people on it atleast to that portion of
it which had f amt specifically described and deeded to him in the marri a sett km mt which he had entered in good faith
with no rer vat ions as to his obscure origin and material equip mei u while the a e had been not only reservation but
act ud misr presentation on their part and misrepresentation of st xh a crass nature as have not only voided and fim st rated at
s a without his knowing it the central motivation of his entire design but to have made an ironic delusion of all that he had
suffered and endured in the past and all tli a the could ever accomplish in the future toward that design which ri aim he had
voluntarily relinquished taking only the twenty out of all he might have claimed and which many another man in his place would have insisted upon
keeping and in which contention would have been supported by both legal and moral sanction even if not the delicate one of conscience and grandfather
not saying wait wait now because it was that innocence again that innocence which believed that the ingredients of morality were like the ingredients of
pie or cake and once you had measured and balanced them and mixed them and put them into the overt it was all finished and
nothing but pic or cake could come out yes sk ting there in grandfathers office trying toy plain with that patient amazed recapitulation not to
grandfather and not to him s df because grandfather said that his very calmness was indication that he had long since given up au y
hope of ever understanding it but trying to explain to c irc nm stance to fate itself the logical steps by which he had arrive
data result absolutely and forever incredible repeating the clear and simple synopsis of hs history which he and grand fet her both now knew as
if he were trying top fp lam it to an in tract i ble and unpredictable child you see i had adc s ninmy mind
whether it was a good or a bad design is beside the point the question is where didi make the mistake in it what didi
door misdo it t it whom or what injure by it to the extent which this wot dd indicate i had a design to accomplish
it i should require money a house a plantation slaves a fit m fly incidentally of coura wife is et out to acquire these asking
no favor of any mani even risked my life at one time as to my out lio ug lias i also tom you i did
not undertake this risk purely and simply to gain a wife though it did have that result but that is beside the point also suffice
that i had the wife accepted her in good faith with no reservations about myself and i expected as much fi rom the mi did
not even demand mind as one of my obscure origin might have be m opec ted to door atleast be condoned in the do it
out of ignorance of gentility in dealing with gende bom people i did not demand i accepted them at their own valuation while in sbt
ion my own part upon explaining billy about myself and my progenitors yet they deliberately withheld from me the one feet which i have reason
to know they were aware would have caused me to decline the entire matter otherwise they would not have withheld it from me afer twh
kh i did not learn until after my son was bom and even then i did not act hastily i could have reminded them of
these wasted years these years which would now leave me b dim d with my schedule not only the amount of e laps al time
which their number represented but that compensatory amount of time represented by their number which i dio ul d now have to ip end to
advance my sd foo cs more to the point i had read bed and lost but i did no tima rely exp la feed how
this new fact rendered it impossible that this woman and child he in corp ox a ted in my design and fd low i eg
which as it old you i made no attempt to keep not only di at which i might consider my s df to have earned
at the risk of my life hut which had been given tome by signed test i moni a is but on the contrary i dined
and resigned all right and claim to this in order that i might repair whatever injustice i might he considered to have done by so
providing for the two pra sons whom imh the consid a red to have d priv ed of anything imi ht later pcbs e and
this was agreed to mind age em to between the two part fes and yet and after more than thirty years more than thirty years
after my com den ce had finally assured me that if i had done an injustice i had done what i could to rectify it
and grand fet her not saying wait now but saying hollering maybe even conscience conscience good god tn an what else did you expect didnt
the very affinity and instinct for misfortune of a man who had spent tih at n nh time in a monastery even let alone one
who had lived r liam mj years as you lived them tell you better than that didnt the dread and fear of females which you
must have drawn in with the primary mammalian milk teach you better what kind of abs mal and purblind innocence could that have been which
someone told you to call virginity what conscience to trade with which would have warranted you in the belief that you could have bought ii
m nui u ty from her for no other coin but justice it was at this point that s hr eve went to the bedroom
and put on the bathrobe he did not say wai the just rose and left quentin sitting before the table the open fc ok and
the letter and went out and returned in the robe and s at again and took up the cold pipe though without filling it a
new or lighting it as it was all right he said so that christmas henry brought him home into the house and the de non
looked up and saw the face he believed he had paid off and discharged twenty eight years a gogo on yes quentin said father said
he probably named him himself charles bon charles goo i he didnt tell grandfather that he did but grandfather b die ved he did would
have that would have been apart of the dean in gnp just as he would have done in s share toward cleaning up the exp
loc fed caps and musket cartridges after the siege if he had nt been sick or maybe engaged he would have in rs is ted
on it may bed be conscience again w hid hi could not allow her and the child anyplace in the desi eventhough he could have
dosed his eyes and if not fooled the rest of the world as they had fooled him atleast have frightened any man out of speaking
the secret aloud the same cons den ce which would not permit the child since it was a boy to hear either his name or
that of its maternal grandfather yet which would also forbid him to do the customary and provide a quick husband for the disc arc fcd
woman and soe his son an authentic name he chose the name himself grand fet her believed just as he named diem all the charles
goods and the c lyte mn estr as and henry and judith and all of them that entire fecundity of dragons teeth as fi it
her called it and fa die r said your f others hr eve said he seems to have got an awful lot of delayed information
aw fi il quick after having waited forty five years if he knew all this what was his reason for telling you that the trouble
bet we a i henry and bon was the oct oro on woman he didnt know it th m grandfather didnt tell him all of
it either likes ttt pc n never told grand ft it her quite all of it than who did tell him i did quentin did
not move did not lookup while s hr eve wat cw him the day after we after that nh t when we ohs hr eve
said after you and the old a unti see goon and f other said said how he must have stood there on the front gallery
that afternoon and waited for henry and the frio id hm ry had been writing home about all ft ll to come up the drive
and that maybe after henry wrote the t tame in the first letters ut pen probably told hh ns df it couldnt be that df
fit c was a i hn it even to irony beyond which it became add either just vicious but not fatal horseplay or harmless coincidence
since father said that even s ut pen probably knew that nobody yet ever invented a name that somebody didn town now or had nt
owned once and they rode up at last and henry sai father this is charles and he the demons hr eve said saw the face
and knew that there are situations where coincidence is no more than the little child that rushes out on to a football field to take
part in the game and the players run over and around the unscathed head and goon and shock together and in the fury of the
struggle for the facts called gain or loss nobody even remembers the child nor saw who came and snatched it back from dissolution that he
stood there a this own door just as he had imagined pl aimed designed and sure enough and after fifty years the forlorn nameless and
homeless lost child came to knock at it and no monkey dressed anywhere under the sun to come to the door and order the child
away and father said that even then eventhough he knew that bon and judith had never laid eyes on one another he must have felt
and heard the design c house position posterity and all comedown like it had been bt out of smoke making no sound creating no rush
of displaced air and not even leaving any debris and he not calling it retribution no sins of the father come home to roost not
even calling it bad luck but just a mistake that mistake which he could not discover himself and which he came to grandfather not to
excuse but just to review the facts for an impartial and grand fet her said he believed a legally trained mind to exf tt nine
and find and point out to him not moral retribution you see just an old mistake in feet which a man of courage and shrewdness
the one of which he now knew he possessed the other of which he believed that he had now learned acquired could still combat if
he could only find oat what the mistake had been because he did not give up he never did give up grandfather said that his
subsequent actions the fact that for a time he did nothing and so perhaps helped to bring about the very situation which he dreaded were
not the result of any fail mg of courage or shrewdness or rudi less ness but were the rul t of his conviction that it
had all come from ami suke and until he discovered what that mistake had been he did not intend to risk making another one so
he invited bonin to the house and for the two weeks of the vacation only it didnt take that long father said that probably mrs
s ut pen had judith and bon already engaged from the moments he saw sons name in henry s first letter he watched bon and
henry and judith or watched bon and judith rather because he would have already known about henry and bon from henry s letters about him
from the school watched them for two weeks and did nothing then henry and bon went back to school and now die groom that fetched
the mail back and forth each week between oxford and s ut pens him dred brought letters to judi di now that were not in
henry shand and that not necessary either father said because mrs s ut pen was already covering he town and county both with news of
that engagement that fathers rid didnt exist yet and still he did nothing he didnt do anything at all until spring was almost over and
henry wrote dia the was bringing bon home with him to stay a day or two before bon went home then s ut pen went
to new or in s whether he chose di at time togo in order to get bon and his mother to ge die rand thrash
the business out for good and all or not nobody knows just as nobody kno vre whether he ever saw the mother or not while
he was there if she received him or refused to receive him or if she did and he tried once more to come to terms
with her buy ha off maybe with money now since father said that a man who co uh be kev c that a scorned and
outraged and angry woman could be bought of ft vith formal logic would believe that she could be placated with money too and it didnt
work or if bon was there and it was bon himself who refused the offer though nobody ever did know if bo never knew s
ut pen was his father or not whether he was trying to revenge his mother or not at first and only later fell in love
only later succumbed to the cu nen t of retribution and fi it ali ty which miss rosa said s ut pen had started and
had doomed all his blood to black and white both but it didnt work evidently and the next christmas came and henry and bon came
tosu t pens hundred again and now s ut pen saw that there was no help for it that judith was in love with bon
and whether bon wanted revenge or was just caught and sunk and doomed too it was all the same so it seems that he sent
for henry that christmas eve just before supper tim fi father said that maybe by now after his new orleans trip he had learned atlas
tai ough about women to know it wouldnt do any good togo to judith first and told henry and he knew what henry would say
and henry said it and he took the lief iom his son and henry knew by his herta ln ng the lie that what his
father had told him was true and father said that he s ut pen probably knew what henry would do too and counted on henry
doing it because he still believed that it had been only a minor tactical mistake so he was like a skirmish er who isom numbered
yet cannot retreat vr iio believes that if he is just patient enough and d ever enough and calm enough and alert e nou he
can get the enemy scattered and pick them off one by one and henry did it and he s ut pen probably knew what henry
would do next too hat henry too w odd goto new orleans to find out for him s df then it was lands ut pen
knew what they would do now not only what henry would do but what he would for a bon to do maybe being a demon
though it would not require a demon to foresee warnow he even foresaw db at henry and bon would join that student company at the
university he may have had some way of watching knowing the day their names appeared on the roster some way of knowing where the company
was even before grandfather became colonel of the regiment the company was in until he got hurt at pittsburgh landing where bon was wounded and
came home to get used to not having any right armand su q ten came home in with the two tombstones and talked to grandfather
in the office that day before both of them went back to the war maybe he knew all the time where henry and bon were
that they had been all the time in grandfathers regiment where grandfather could look after them in a fad ii on even if grand fit
th cr didnt know that he was doing it even if t ly needed watching because s ut pen must have known about the probation
too what henry was doi rg now holding all three of them him s df and judith and bon india tso s pena on while
he wrestled with his c nos den ce to make it come to terms with what he wanted to do just like his ff it
her had di at time more chan thirty years ago maybe even turned fatalist like bon now and giving the war ad ce to settle
the whole business by killing him or bon of both of the mut with noh dp no fudging on his part because it was him
that carried bon to the rear after ph t shu rg landing or maybe he knew that the s oud bt would be whipped and
then there wouldn the anything left that mattered that much w th getting di at heated over worf fi protest ii g against or suffering
for or dying for or even li vii gf in that was the day came to tie ce hb the demo uss hr eve one
day of la cve at home came home with his tombstones ju it h was there and i reckon he looked at her and she
looked at him and he said you know where he is and judith didnt lie to him and he knew henry he said but you
have not heard from him yet and judith didnt lie about that either and she didnt cry either because both of them knew what would
be in the letter when it came so he didnt have to ask when he writes youth a the is coming you and ck tie
will start making the wedding dress even if judith would have lied to him about that which she would not have so he put one
of the stones on ellens grave and set the other one up m the hall and came into see grandfather trying to explain it seeing
if grandfather could discover that mistake which he be he ved was the sole cause of his problem sitting there in his worn and shabby
uniform with his worn ga und ets and faded sash andie would have had the plume by all means he might have had to discard
his saber but he would have had the plume the plume in his hat broken and frayed and soiled with his horse saddled and waiting
in the street below and a thousand miles to ride to find his he sitting there on the one afternoon of his l ve as
though he had a thousand of them as if there were no has tenor urgency anywhere under the sun and that when he departed he
had no further togo than the twelve miles out tosu t pens hundred and a thousand days or maybe even years of monotony and rich
peace and he even after he would become dead still there still watching the fine grandsons and great grandsons springing as fer as eye cou
mr each he still eventhough dead in the earth that same fine figure of a man that wadi jones called him but not now now
fogbound by his own private em bat demento f personal morality di at picayune splitting of abstract hairs while grand f other said rome vanished
and jeri dio crumbled that a is would be right i for that would be tv ton but of slowing blood and stiffening bones and
arteries that father says men resort to in senility who while young and supple and strong re a aed to a single simple yes and
a single simple no as instantaneous and complete and unthinking as the snapping on and off of electricity sitting there and talking and now grandfather
not knowing what he was talk ii about because now grandfather said he did not believe that s ut pen himself knew because even yet
s ut pen had not quite told him all of it and this that morality again grandfather said that morality wh idi would not permit
him to malign or traduce the memory of his first wife or atleast the memory of rite marriage eventhough he felt that he had been
tricked by it not even to an acquaintance in whose confidence and discretion he trusted enough to wish to justify himself not even to his
son by another marriage in order to preserve the status of his lifes attainment and desire except as a last resort not that he would
hesitate then grandfather said but not until then had been tricked by it himself but he had oct rica ted himself without asking or receiving
help fi o many man let anyone else who might be so imposed i pondo the same sitting there and moralizing on the fic tdi
at no matter which course he chose the le sul t would be that that de agn and plan to which he bad given fifty
years of his lift had just as wd q new r have existed at all by almost exactly fifty years and gr md father not
knowing what ch he was talking about even what second choice he was faced with until the very last word he spoke before he got
up and put on his hat and shook grandfathers lefthand miro de away this second choi tte need to dio o seas obscure to grandfather
as there in for the first the repudiation had been so that grandfather did not even sayid on t know which you should choose not
because that was all he tul d have s a and so to say that would be less dm no answer at all but that
any dung he might have said would have been less than no answer at all since sue n was not listen mg did not expect
an answer who had not come for pit and there was no advice that he could have taken and justification he had already coerced from
his conscience thirty years ago and he still knew that he had courage and di ough he may have come to doubt lately that he
had acquired that shrewdness which at one time he believed he had he still believed that it existed somewhere in the world to be if
tam fd and that if it could be learned he would yet learn it and maybe even this grandfather said if shrewdness could not extricate
bim this second time as it had before he could atleast depend on the courage to find him will and strength to make a third
start toward that design as it had found him to make the second wit li who came into the office not for pity and not
for help because grandfather said he had never learned how to ask anybody for help or anything else and so he would not have known
what to do with the help if grand ff it her could have given it to him but came just with that sober and quiet
bemuse ment hoping maybe ff i he hoped at all if he were doing anything but just thinking out loud at all that thc lal
mind mit per ed ve and dari fy that miri al mistake which he still insisted on which he himself had not been able to
find was faced with condoning a feet which had been foisted upon me without my knowledge during the process of building toward my design which
meant the absolute and irrevocable negation of the design or in holding to my or in al plan for the design in pursuit of w

which i might make either course which i might choose leads to the same result eid i eri destroy my design with my own hand
which will happen if iam forced to play my last trump card or do nothing let matters take the course which i know they will
take and see my design complete itself quite normally and naturally and successfully to the public eye yet to my own in such fashion as
to be a mockery and a betrayal of that litt k boy who approached that door fifty years ago and was mme d away for
whose vindication the whole plan was conceived and carried forward to the moment of this choice this second choice devolving out of that first one
which in its turn was forced on me as the result of an agreement an arrangement which i had entered in good faith concealing nothing
while die other party or parties to it concealed from me the one very factor which would destroy the entire plan and design which i
had been working toward concealed it so well that it was not until after the child was bom that i discovered chat this factored s

asl in and two other old men hobble out and stop him he sitting i he stallion and talking to them and his voice not
raised grand fa foer said yet the very sober qu ty of his gestures and die set of his should forensic oratorical the q he
went on he could still reach s ut pens hundred before dark so it was probably after supper than he headed the stallion toward the
atlantic ocean he and judith facing one another again for maybe a full minute he not needing to say i will stop it if i
can she not needing to says top it then if you can but just goodbye the kiss on the brow and not ears a word
to clyde and to wash master to slave baron to retainer well clyde take care of miss judit l wash rus end you a piece
of a be lincolns coat tail from washington and i reckon wash answering like it used to be under the s cup pemon gs with
the demijohn and the well buckets ho kernel kill ever one of the varmints so he ate the hoe cake and drank the parched acorn
coffee and rode away then it was and the army grandfather had gone back to it too he was a brigadier now though i reckon
this was for more reason than because he just had one arm had retreated across georgia and into carolina and they all knew it wouldnt
be very much longer now the none day lee sent johnston some reinforcements from one of his corps and grandfather found out that the twenty
third mississippi was one of the regiments and he grandfather didnt know what had happened whether s ut pen had found out in some way
that henry had at last coerced his conscience into agreeing with him as his henry s father had done thirty years ago whether judith perhaps
w written her father that she had heard from bon at last and what she and bon intended to door if theft iur of them
had just reached as one person that point where something had to be done had to happen he grant her didnt know he just learned
one morning that s ut pen had ridden up to grandfather sold regiments headquarters and asked and received permission to speak to henry and did
sf ak to him and then rode away again before mid nig so he go this choice made after all s hr eve said he
played that trump after ali and so he camp home and found wait quentin said what he must have wanted to find or anyway what
he was going to find wait i tell you quentin said though still he did not move nor even raise his voice that voice with
its tense suffused restrained quality iam telling ami going to have to have to hear it all again he thought iam going to have to
hear it all over again iam already hearing it all over again i listening to it all over again is hall have to never listen
to anything else but this again forever so patently not only a man never outlives his father but not even his friends and acquaintances do
he came home and found that atleast regarding which he should have needed no word nor warning even if judith would have s a st
him one sent him ac know led gn a ent that she was be atm who according to mr comp son would no more have
sent hm acknowledgment that he had beat her than she waited whom miss coldfield said was not bereaved and met him on his return not
with the fury and despair perhaps which he might have expected eva it hoi knowing a slit de having learned a slit de about wo
mai as mr comp son said he had yet certainly with something other than the icy calm wah winch according to miss coldfield she met
him die kiss again after almost two yea non the brow the voices the speeches quiet contained almost impersonal and i yes henry killed him
followed by the brief tears which ceased on dm instant when they began as if the moisture consisted of a single die et or layer
t as a cigarette paper and in the di ape of a human face the a hcl y tie ah wdf f was hi was
unable to penetrate fer enough b di in d die yai lines to cuta piece fi rom di at coat tail as ii mxn nmi
sed you the from jones guffaw the chortle the old imbecile stability of the articulated mud which mr comp son said outlasts the victories and
the defeats bothwell kernel they kilt us but they a in twh upped us y it air they and that was all he had returned
he was home again where his problem now was haste passing time the need to hurry he was not concerned mr comp son said about
the courage and the will nor even about the shrewdness now he was not for one moment concerned about his ability to start the third
time all that he was concerned about was the possibility that he might not have time sufficient to do it in regain his lost ground
in he did not waste any of what time he had either the will and the shrewd ties s too he did not waste though
he doubtless did not consider it to have been either his will or his shrewdness which supplied waiting to his hand the opportunity and it
iv as probably less of shrewdness and more of courage than even will which got him engaged to miss rosa within a period of three
months and almost before she was aware of the fact miss rosa die chief disciple and advocate of that cult of demon harrying of which
he was the chief object eventhough not victim engaged to him before she had got accustomed to having him in the house yes more of
cour eg ethan even will yet something of shrewdness too the shrewdness acquired in ex mt ti at in gab lets through the fifty years
suddenly capit dant and retroactive or suddenly sprouting and f lot ve ring like a seed la in fallow in a vacuum or in a
single iron clod because he seemed to perceive wi dt out stopping in that passage through the house iv huh was an unbroken continue ui
on of the long journey from virginia the pause not to greet his family but merely to pickup jones and drag him o not a
to the brie roke d fields and fdl en fences and d apax or mattock in tofu s hands the one weed is pot die
one spot vulnerable to assault in miss rosa s embattled spinsterhood and to assault md carry this in one stride with something of the nd
kes st tud cal d du of his old master die twenty third ms st tei pf fia ys was in jacksons corps at one
time and then the shrewdness failed him again it broke down it vanished into that old impotent logic and morality which had betrayed him before
md what day might it have been what furrow might he have stopped dead in one foot advanced the un sentient plow handles in his
instantaneous u u sentient hands what fence panel held in midair as though it had now eight by muscles which could not feel it token
he realized that there was more in his problem than just lack of time that the problem contained some super distillation of this lack that
he was now past sixty and that possibly he could get but one more son had at best but one more son in his loins
as the old cannon might know when it has just one more shot in its corporeal it y so he suggested what he suggested to
her and she did iv ha the should have known she would do and would have known probably if he had not bogged himself again
in his morality which had all the parts but which refused to run to move hence the proposal the outrage and unbelief the tide the
blast of indignation and anger upon which miss rosa vanished from sui pens hundred her air ballooned skirts spread upon the flood chip light her
bonnet possibly one of ellens which she had prowled out of the at ii c clapped fast on to her head rigid and precarious with
rage a fid he standing there with ate reins over his arm with perhaps something like smiling inside his beard and about the eyes tv
hi ch was not smiling hut the crinkled concentration of furious thinking the haste the need far it the urgency but not fear not concern
just the fact that he had missed that time though luckily it was just as po u ing shot with a light charge and the
old gun the old barrel and carriage none the worse only next time there might not be enough powder for both a spotting shot and
then a full sized had the fad that the thread of shrewdness and courage and will ran on to the same spool which the thread
of his remaining days ran on to and that spool almost near enough for him to reach out his hand md touch it but this
was no ave concern yet since it the old logic the old morality which had never yet failed to fail him was already ft dling
into pattern already showing him conclusively that he had been right ju a a shek ft ew he had been and therefore what had happened
was j mta delusion and did not actually exist nosh re ve said you wait let mep kya w me now now wash him die
demon standing there with the horse the saddled charge rd he sheathed saber the gray waiting to be laid peaceful away among the mod is
and all lost save dishonor then the voice of the faithful grave digger who opened the p ky and would dose it coming out of
the wings like shakespeare s very self well kernel die y m ought have wh upped us but they a in t kilt us y
it air dx ey this was not flippancy either it too was just that protective coloring of levity behind which the youthful shame of being
moved hid itself out of which quentin also spoke the reason for quentin s sullen bemuse ment the on both their parts flip ness the
strained clowning the two of them whether they knew it or not in the cold room it was quite cold now dedicated to that b
of ratio ci nation which after all was a good deal likes utp a is morality and miss coldfield s demon i zing this room
not only dedicated to it but set aside for it and suitably so since it would be here a bq ve any other place that
it the logic and the morality could do the least am bunt of harm the two of them bade to back as though at the
last ditch saying no to quentin s mississippi shade whom life had acted and reacted to the minimum of logic and morality who dying had
escaped it comp let dy who dead remained not only m different but impervious to it somehow a thousand times more potent and alive there
was no harm m tended by s hr eve and no harm taken d nee quoit in did not even stop he did not even
fd ter takings hr eve up in str kk without comma or colon or parr a ph tno reserve to risk a spotting shot with
now so he so started this one like you start a rabbit out of a brier patch with a little chunk of dried mud thrown
by hand maybe it was the first string of beads out of his and was hs little store where he would get mad a this
customers the nig gen and the trash and the haggling and turn them out and lock the door and drink himself blind and maybe wash
delivered the beads himself i father said that was down at the gate when he rode back fi rom the war that day that after
he went away with the regiment would tee folks that he wash was loo g after kernels place and sim til after a while maybe
he even believed it fathers mother said how when the s ut pen fin the ard about what he was saying they would stop him
in the road that came up out of the bottom where the old fishing camp was that s utp a i let him and the
granddaughter she was about eight then live in there would be too many of them for him to whip the mad to even try to
risk trying to and they would ask him why he wasnt at the war and he would say g it out en my road and
then it would be the outright lau i in gas king one another except it was not one another but him who him calling us
nger stand he would rush at them with a stick and them avoiding him just enough not mad at all just laughing and he was
st ifl carrying f if ti and animal shek ie ed or maybe stole and vegetables up to the house when that was about aum
rss ut pen and judith and clyde too had to live on and clyde would not let him come into the kitchen with the basket
even saying stop right there whiteman stop right where you is you a in t never crossed this door while colonel was here and you
a in t going to cross it now which was true only father said there was a kind of prick in it that he had
never tried to enter the house even af th gh he believed that if he had tried s ut pen would not have let them
repulse him like father said he mit have x said to himself the reason i wont try it a in t that i refuse to
give any black the chance to tell mei cant hut because i amt going to force mister tom to have to cuss a or take
a cussing from his wife on my account but they would dn nk together under the s cup pemon garbo ron the sunday afternoons and
on the weekdays he would sees ut pen the fine figure of the man as he c au edit on the black stallion galloping about
the plantation and father said how for that moment was hs heart would be quiet and proud both and that maybe it would seem to
him that this world where that the bible said had been created and cursed by god to be brute and vassal to all men of
white skin were better found and housed and een clothed than he and his granddaughter that this world where he walked always in mocking and
jeer mg echoes of laughter was just a dream and an illusion and that the actual world was the one where his own lonely apotheosis
father said galloped on the black thoroughbred thinking maybe father said how the book said that all men were created in the image of god
and so all men were the same in gods eyes anyway looked the same to god atleast and so he would look at s ut
pen and think a fine proud man if cod himself was to comedown and ride the natural earth th acs what he would aim to
look like maybe he even delivered the first string of beads himself and father said maybe each of then b bons afterward during the next
three yes while the girl matured fi is t like girls of that kind door anyway he would know and recognize each and every ribbon
when he saw it on her even when she lied to him about where md how she got it which she probably did not since
she would be bound to know that he had been seeing dte ribbons in the dio w case everyday for three years and would have
known them as well as he knew hf town shoes and not tm ly he knew them but all the other men the customers and
the as z lounge rs the white and the bk ck that would be sitting and squatting about the stores gallery to watch her pass
not quite defiant and not quite cringing and not quite f lau nong then b bons and the beads but almost not quite any of
them but a little of all bold sullen and fearful but father said how was hs heart was probably soil quiet even after he saw
the dress and spoke about it probably only a little grave now and watching her secret defiant frightened face while she told him before he
had asked maybe too insistent too quick to volunteer it that miss judith had given it to her helped her to make it and father
said maybe he realized all of a sudden and without warning tli at when he passed the men on the gallery they would look after
him too and that tli ey already knew that which he had just thought they were probably thinking but father said his heart was soil
quiet even now and that he answered if he answered at all stopped the protestations and disclaimers at all sho now ef kernel and miss
judith wanted to give hit to you i hope you minded to thank them not alarmed father said jus thoughtful just grave and father said
how that afternoon grand fet her rode out to sees ut qi en about something and there was nobody in the front of the store
and he was about togo out and go up to the house when he heard the voices from the back and he walked on toward
them and so he overheard them before he could begin to not listen and before he could make them hear him callings ut pens name
grandfather couldnt see them ye the had nt even got to where they could hear him yet but he said he knew ex aed y
how they would be s ut pen having already told wash to get the jug out and then wash spoke and s ut pen beginning
to turn realizing that wash wasnt getting the jug before he comprehended the import of what wash was saying dien comprehend mg that and still
half turned and then all of a sudden kind of reared back and flinging his head up looking at was hand wash standing there not
cringing either in th tu attitude dogged and quiet and not cringing and s ut pen said what about the dress and grandfather said it
was s ut pens voice that was short and sharp not was hs that was hs voice was just flat and quiet not abject just
patient and slow i have know ed you for going on twenty years now iain t never denied y it to do what you told
me to do and imam an past sixty and she aim nothing but a fifteen year old ga lands ut pen said meaning that id
harm the girl i a man a sold as you arc and wash if you was arra other man id say you was a sold
as me and old or no old i wouldnt let her keep that dress nor nothing else that come from your hand but you a
red if le rent and s ut pen how different and grandfather said how wash did not answer and that he called again now and
neither of them heard him and then s ut pen said so that s why you are afraid of me and wash said iain t
afraid because you are brave it a in t that you were a brave man at one second or minute or hour of your life
and got a paper to show hit f iom general lee but you are brave the same as you area live and breathing that s
vs here its different hit rh j nt need no ticket from nobody to tell me that and know that whatever your hands tech whether
hit sale pm mt of menor a ignorant gal or just a hounddog that you will make hit right then grandfather heard s ut pen
move sudden and sharp and grandfather said he reckoned thought just about what he imagined wash was thinking but all s ut poi said was
get the jugs ho kernel wash said so that sunday came a year after that day and three years after he had suggested to mm
rosa that they try it first and if it was a boy and lived they would be married it was before day ht and he
was expecting his mare to foal to the black stall it m so when he k ft the house before day that mot n jug
judith though the was go mg to the stab k what jt dith knew and how much about her father and was hs granddaughter nobody
knew how much she could not have helped but know from what clyde must have known may have or may not have told her whether
or no since everybody else white or black in the neighborhood knew who had ever seen the girl pass in the ribbons and be which
they all recognized how much she may have refused to discover during the fitting and sewing of that dress father said judith actually did this
this was no lie that the girl told wash the two of the malone all day long for about a week in the house and
what they must have talked about what judith must have talked about while the girl stood around in what she possessed to call underclothes with
her sullen defiant secret watchful face answering what telling what that judith mayor may not have tried to shu the reyes to nobody knew so
it was not until he i led to return at dinner time that she went or sent c ly tie to the stable and found
that them are had f oak d in the night but that her fet her was not there and it was not until mi daft
emo on that she found a half grown boy and paid him an id kel togo down to the old fish ramp and ask wash
where s ut pen was and the boy walked whistling around the comer of the rotting cabin and saw maybe die scythe first maybe the
body first lying in the weeds w bid h wash had not yet cut and as he screamed he in rike dup and saw wash
in the window watching h then about a week later they caught the the midwife fl t td she told how she didnt know that
wash was there at all that dawn when she heard the horse and then s ut pens feet and her amr in and stood over
the pallet where the g jr and the baby were and s dd penelope that was them are foaled this morning a damned fine colt
going to be dies pit and image of his m dy when i rode him north in ido you remembers and the old said she
said yes mars ter and that he jerked the riding whip toward the pallet and said wells damn your black hide horse or mares and
that she told him and that he stood there for a minute and he didnt move at all with the riding whip la in s
this leg and the lattices of sunlight fi rom the un chinked wall falling upon him across his white hair and his beard that had
nt turned at all yet and she said she saw his eyes and then his teeth inside his beard and that she would have run
then only she couldnt couldnt seem to make her le bear to gp t up and run and then he looked at the girl on
the pallet again and said well milly too bad you re not a marc too then i could give you a decent stall in the
stable and turned and went out only she could not move even yet and she didnt even know that wash was outside there she just
heard s ut pen say stand back was l dont you touch me and then wash his voice soft and hardly loud enough to reach
he rim going to tech you kernel and s ut pen against and backwash sharp now and then she heard the whip on was hs
fit ce but she didnt know if she heard the scythe or not because now she found out that she could move getup run out
of the cabin and into the weeds running waits ht eve said wait you mean that he had got the son at last that he
wanted yet still he walked the three miles and back before midnight tx fetch the old then s at on the sagging gallery until day
lh t came and the granddaughter stopped screaming inside the aib in and he even heard the baby once waiting for s ut pen and
father said his heart was quiet then too eventhough he knew what they would be saying in every cabin about the land by night fell
just as he had known what they were saying daring the last four or five months while his granddaughters condition which he had never tried
to conceal could no longer be mistaken wash jones has fixed olds ut pen at last it tan him ti vent y years to do
it hu the has got a holt of olds ut pen at last where s ut pen will either have to tear meat or squeal
that s what father said he was thinking while he waited outside on the gallery where the old had sent him ordered him outstanding there
maybe by the very post where the scythe had leaned rusting for two years while the grand da th ter s screams came steady as
a clock now but his own heart quiet not at all concerned not alarmed and father said that maybe while he stood bc fogged in
his fumbling and groping that morality of his that was a good deal likes ut pens that told him he was right in the fec
e of all fact and usage and everything else which had always been somehow mixed up and involved with galloping hoofs even during the old
peace that nobody remembered and in which dur ii the four years of die war which he had not attended the gallop i og had
been only the more gallant and proud and t him de rous father said that maybe he go this answer that maybe there broke free
and plain in mid gallop against the yellow sky of dawn die fine proud image of the manon the fine proud image of dies tal
hon and tint the fumbling and the groping broke dear and free too not in justification ores la nation or extenuation or ex c me
father said but as the apotheosis lonely explicable beyond all human fouling he is hig ger thane dl them yankees that killed us and our
n that killed his tv if e and widowed his daughter and dr uv his son from home that stole his mg gers and ruined
his land bigger than this whole county that he fit for and in payment for which has b rung him to keeping a little country
store for his bread and meat bigger than the scorn cm d denial which hit belt to his ups like the um cup in the
book and how a midi have lived night o him for twenty years without be ir touched and dum ged by him may iam not
as big as he is m tdma fit ei did as not do my of t lie galloping but atleast i was drug along where
hewett i and me and him can still do hit and will ever so if so be he will show me what he aims forme
to do and maybe soli standing die re and holding the stallions reins after s nt pen had entered the cabin still hearing the galloping
watching the proud galloping image merge and pass galloping through avatars which marked the accumulation of years time to the fine climax where it galloped
without weariness or progress forever and forever immortal beneath the brandished saber and the di otto m flags rushing down a sky in color like
th understood there and hds ut pen inside the house speak his single sentence of salutation inquiry and farewell to tie granddaughter and father said
di at for a second wash must not have felt the very earth under his feet while he watched s utp ene mei ef i
rom the house the riding whip in his hand thinking quietly like in a dream ika in t have heard what i know i heard
i just know ika in t thinking t tu u was what got him up it was that coil i tmnt me or mine either
it wasnt even his own that gat him out of bed maybe feeling no earth no stability even yet maybe not even hearing his own
voice when s ut pens awb usf ece the face of the man who in twenty years he had no more known to make any
move save at command than he had the stallion which he rode and s toed you said if she was am are you could give
her a decent stall in the stable maybe not even hearings ut pen when he said sudden and sharp stand back dont you touch me
only he mint have heard ft i at because he answered kim going to tech you kernel and s ut pen said stand backwash before
the om woman heard the vs di ip only th a ewe ce two bf ow s with the whip they found the two wd
t son was hs fec eth s a night maybe the two blows even knocked him down maybe k was while he was getting fl
bathe hk on the scythe waits lire ve said for christ s sake wait you mean that he s at there ail that day in
the kt de window where he could watch the road probably laid the scythe down and went straight into the house where maybe the granddaughter
on the pallet asked querulously what it was and he answered w hut j w hut racket honey t and maybe he tried to persuade
her to eat too the a de meat he had probably brought home from the store saturday night or maybe die candy trying to tempt
her with it maybe the nickels worth of stale jell if i ed glue out of a striped sack and may beate and then s
at at the window where he could lookout above the body and the scythe in the weeds below and watch the road because he was
sitting there when the half grown boy came around the comer of the house whistling and saw him and father said he must have re
ah ved dim that it would not be much after dark when it would happen that he must have s at there and sensed felt
them gathering with the horses and dogs and guns the curious and the vengeful men of s ut pens own kind who used to eat
a this table with him bade when he wash had yet to approach nearer the house than the s cup pemon garb ormen who had
led the way di own the other and lesser one show to fight in bat des who might also possess agne d papers from the
generals saying that they were among the first and foremost of the brave who had galloped also in the old days arrogant and proud on
the fine horses about the fine plantations symbol also of admiration and hope instruments too of despair and grief these it was whom he was
expected to run from and it seeming to him probably that he had no less to run from than he had to tun to that
if her an he would be fled ng mer dy one set of bragging and evil shadows for another since they men were all of
a kind th rou out all of earth w lud h he knew and he old too old to nm far even if he were
to run who could never escape diem nom at mr how much or how far her a naman past sixty could not exp eo to
run that far far enough to escape beyond the boundaries of earth where such men li val set the order and the rule of living
and father said that maybe for the first time in his life he began to com pre heid how it had be a i possible
for yankees or any od ber army to have whipped them the gallant the proud the brave the acknowledged and chosen best among them all
to bear the course and honor and pride it would probably be about sunset now and probably he could feel them quite near now father
said it probably seemed to him dia the could even hear them all the voices the murmuring of tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow beyond the
immediate fury old wash jones come a tumble atlas the though the had s ut pen huts ut pen fooled him he dw ugh the
had him but old wash jones got fooled and then maybe even saying it aloud shouting it father said but in ever esq pec ted
that kernel you know in ever until maybe the granddaughter stirred and spoke querulously again and he went and quieted her and returned to talk
to himself again but careful now quiet now since s ut pen was dose enough to hear him easy without shouting you know in ever
you know in ever expected or asked or wanted nothing from arra living man but what ioc pec ted from you and in ever aed
that i didnt di in fc hit would need ij mt said to myself i dont need to what need has a fellow like wash
jones to question or doubt the man that gene r td lee himself said in a hand wrote ticket that he was brae e brave
and maybe it would be loud again forgetting again brave better if nam one of them had ever rid bai in thinking better if his
i dnd and mine too had never drawn the breath of life on this earth better duo all who remain of us be blasted from
the face fit t fu m dima tu her wash jones should see b is whole life shredded from him and shrivel away like a
dried shuck t brow tion to the fire then they rode up ee must have been listening to them as they came down the road
the dogs and the horses and seen the lanterns since it was dark now and mor de spam who was sheriff then got dow m
and saw the body though he said he did not see wash nor know that he was there uno l wash spoke his name qui
ed y from the window almost in his face that you major de spain told him to come on out and he said how was
hs voice was quite quiet when he said he would be out in just a minute it was too quiet too calm so much too
quiet and calm that de spain said he did not realize for a moment that it was too calm and quiet in just a minute
soon as i see about my granddaughter well see to her de spain said you come on out sho major wash said in just a
minute so they waited in front of the dark house and the next day father said there were a hundred that remembered about the but
d rer kn if rtha the kt hidden and razor sharp die one thing in his sloven life that he was ever known to take
pr it fein or care of only by the time they remembered all this it was took te so they did at know what he
was about they just heard him moving inside the dark house then they heard the granddaughters voice fretful and querulous who is it light the
lamp grand paw then his voice hit wont need no light honey hit wont take but a minute then de spain drew his pistol and
said you wash come out of there and still wash didnt answer murmuring still to the granddaughter wher air you and the fretful voice answering
right here where else would i be what is then de spain said jones and he was already fumbling at the broken steps when the
granddaughter screamed and now all the men the reclaimed that die y heard the knife on both the neck bones though de spain didn the
just said he knew that wash had come out oak jt lie gallery and that he sprang back before he found out that it was
not toward him wash was running but toward the end of the gallery where the body lay but that he did not think about the
scythe he just ran backward a few feet wha i he saw wash stoop and rise again and now wash was running toward him only
he was running toward them all de spain said running into the lanterns so that now they could see the scythe raised above his head
they could see his face his eyes too as her an with the scythe above his head stra ht into the lanterns and the gun
barrels making no sound no outcry while de spain ran backward before him saying jones stop stop or ill kill you jones jon ra jones
waits hr eve said you mean that he got the son he wanted after all that trouble and then turned right around and yes sitting
in grandfathers office that afternoon with his head kind of dung back a little explaining to grandfather like he might have been explaining arithmetic to
henry back in the fourth grade you see all i wanted was just as on which seems tome when i look about at my contemporary
scene no exorbitant gift from nature or circumstance to demand witt you waits hr eve said that with the son he went to all that
trouble to get lying right there behind him in the cabin he would have to taunt the grand fet her into killing first him and
then the child toot what t quentin said it wasnt as on it was a gir roh s hr eve said come on lets gr

ozen and empty quad beyond which the windows in the opposite wall were with two or three exceptions already dark soon the chimes would ring
for midnight die notes melodious and tranquil ft and dear as glass in the fierce it had quit snowing still air so the oldman sent
the for henry s hr eve said and henry can a e in and the oldman said they cannot marry because he is your brother
and henry said you lie like that that quick no ace no interval nono th bg between like when you press ac button and get
fight in the room and the oldman just s at there didnt even move and strike him and so henry didnt say fie again because
he knew now it was so he just said its not true not i dont believe it but its not true because he could maybe
see the oldman sf ice a in now and demon or no it was a kind of grief and pity not for himself but for
henry because henry was just young while he the did man knew that he still had the courage and even all the shrewdness too s
hr eve stood beside the table facing que nr in again though not seated now in the overcoat buttoned awry over the bathrobe he looked

violent changes of temperature pei hap s per ha merely nearer the surface who s at huq c lied in ids chair his hands thrust
into his pod bets as if he were trying to hug himself warm between h harms looking somehow fragile and even wan in the lamp

of those people whose correct age you never know because they look esa cd y that and so you tee yourself that he or she

he or she is either that age which die y claim or that which in sheer desperation they agree to or which someone else reports
them to be strong e nou and willing enough for two for two thousand for all not two of them in a new england college

garden pacing slowly foe sisters head bent with listening foe lovers head leaned above it while they paced slowly on in that rhythm which nee
foy e eyes but foe heart marks and calls foe beat and measure for to disappear slowly beyond some bufo or s hn fo starred
with white bloom jasmine spiraea honeysuckle perhaps myriad scentless unpick able cherokee roses names blooms which s hrc ve possibly had never heard and never
seen although the air had blown over him first which became tempered to nourish them it would not matter here in cambridge that the time
had been winter in that garden too and hence no bloom nor leaf even if there had been someone to walk there and be seen
there since judged by subsequent events it had been night in the garden also but that did not matter because it had been so long
ago it did not matter to them quentin and s hr eve anyway who could without moving as free now of flesh as the father
who decreed and forbade the son who denied and repudiated the lover who acquiesced the beloved who was not bereaved and with no tedious transition
fir omh earth and garden to saddle who could be already clattering over the frozen ruts of that december night and that c iris tm
as dawn that day of peace md cheer of holly and goodwill and loon th ehci th not two of them there and the neither
but four of t bpm riding the two hot ses th roth their on darkness and fb at not matter ii other what fi ices
and what names they called themselves and were called by so long as the blood coursed the blood the immortal brief recent in transient blood
which could hold honor above slot hyun regret and love above fat and easy shame and bon didnt know its hr eve said the oldman
didnt move and this time henry didnt say you lie he said its not true and the oldman said ask him a skn bar lps
then and then henry knew that that was what his fet li w had meant all the time and that that was what he meant
himself when he told his father he lied because what the oldman said wasnt just he is your brother but if chas known all the
time that he is yours and your sisters brother but bon didnt know listen dont you remember how your father said it that not one
time did he tie old guy the demon ever seem to wonder how die other wife manned to find him track him down had never
once seemed to wonder what she might have been doing all that time the thirty years since that daywhen he paid his bill with her
and got it receipted so he thought and saw with his own eyes that it was so he thought destroyed tom up and throw m
to the wind never once wondered about this bat only that she had done it could have and would have wanted to track him down
so it was nther that told bon she wouldnt have wanted to maybe for the reason that she knew he the demon would believe she
had or maybe she didnt get around to telling him maybe she just never thought that there could be anyone as close to her as
alone d ii ld out of her own body who would have to be told how she had been scorned and sufi ered or maybe
she was already telling it before he was big enough to know words and so by the time he was big enough to under et
and what was being told him she had told it so much and so hard that the words didnt make sense to her anymore either
because they didnt have to make sense to her and so she had got to the point where when she thought she was a ying
it she was quiet and who as he thought she was quiet h was just the hate and the fury and the uns lc epic
g and the un forgetting or maybe she didnt intend for him to know it then maybe she was grooming him for that hour and
moment which she oi ul d nt foresee but that she knew would arrive someday because it would have to arrive or else she would
have to do like the aunt rosa and deny that she had ever breathed the moment when he bon would stand side by side not
facet of i ice wh h his fed i er where ecu luck or jost ice or what evac d ted afl it ou nld
do the rest and it did better than she could have invented or hoped or even dreamed and your fet her said how bd nga
woman she probably wasnt even surprised grooming him herself bringing him on by hand herself washing and he ding and putt mg him to bed
and giving him the candy and the toys and the other childs fun and diversion and needs in measured doses like medicine with her own
hand not because she had to who could have hired a dozen or bought a hundred to do it for her wi di the money
the jack that he the demon had voluntarily surrendered repudiated to balance his moral ledger but like the millionaire who could have a hundred hostlers
and handlers but who has just the one horse the one maiden the one moment the one matching of heart and muscle and will with
the one instant and him s df the millionaire patient in the overalls and the sweat and the stable muck and the mother bringing him
along to the moment when she would say he is your the r he cast you and me aside and denied you his name now
go and then s it down and let god finish it pistol or knife or rack destruction or grief orai u ish god to call
the shot or turn the whe d jesus you can almost see him a et de boy already come to kam to expert before he
could remember having learned his own name or the name of the town where he lived or how to say either of them that every
so often he would be snatched up from playing and held gripped between the two hands fierce with what passed atleast with him for it
love against the two fierce rigid knees the face that he remembered since before remembering began as supervising all the animal joys of palate and
stomach and entrails of warmth and pleasure and security swoop i rg down at him in a km d of blazing immobility he taking the
interruption as a matter of course as just another natural phenom a ion of eds ten ce the face fi he d with furious and
almost unbearable un foi ving almost like f over not bitterness and d pair just implacable will for revenge as just a no die r
manifestation of mammalian love and be not knowing what in hell it was all about he would be too young to curry any connected fact
out of the fury and hate and the tumbling speed not comprehending or caring just curious creating for himself without help since who to help
him his own notion of that port obi coor haiti or wherever it was he understood vaguely that he had come fi rom like orthodox
child ra a do of heaven or the cabbage patch or wherever it was that they came from except that his was different in that
you were not supposed your mother didnt intend to anyway to ever go back there and maybe when you got a sold as she was
you would be horrified too everytime you fen nd hidden in your tho vh ts anything that just smelled or tasted like it might be
a wish togo back there you were not supposed to know wha i and why you left but only that you had escaped that whatever
power had created the place for you to hate it had likewise got you away from the place so you could hate it good and
never fore it in quiet and mc mo tony though not exactly in what you would call peace that you were to thank god you
didnt rem embo anything about it yet at the sametime you were nott maybe dared not to ever forget i the not even knowing maybe
that he took it for granted that all kids didnt have fet her s too and that getting matched e vary day cff so from
whatever lu um less pui smt in which you were not bothering anybody or even thinking about them by someone because that someone was bigger

wh i hah modi m ff hil drm had re cd ved in turn fr tm th drm cd ben and from th dr mothers
in turn from th a porto rico or haiti or wherever it was we all came from but none of us ever lived in so
that when he grew up and had children he would have to pass it on too and maybe dc a ding dien and there that
it was too much trouble and bother and that he would not have any children or atleast hoped he would not and hence no man
had a father noone personal porto rko or haiti but all mother faces whichever bred swooping down at those almost calculable moments out of some
obscure ancient general a j front mg and out rag ir which the actual living articulate meat had not even suffered but merely inherited all
boy flesh that walked and breathed stemming from that one ambiguous eluded dark father head and so brother ed perennial and ubiquitous everywhere under the
sun quentin and sh re vesta red at one another glared rather their quiet regular breathing vapor ian gfa indy and steadily in the now
to mbh kea iri here was something curious in the way they looked at one another curious and quiet and pro foi mdl y intent
not at all as two young men might look at each other but almost as a youth and a very young might out of virginity
itself a sort of hushed and naked spar rhin g each look burdened with youths immemorial obsession not with times dragging weight which the old
live with but with its fluidity the bright heels of all the lost moments of fifteen and sixteen then he got older and got out
from under the apron despite her despite him too maybe maybe the both of them and he didnt even care he found out that she
was up to something and he not only didnt care he didnt even care that he didnt know what it was he got older and
found out that f lie had been shying and tempering him to be the instrument for whatever it was her hand was implacable for may
became to b dr eve or s a what site had tricked him into receiving di at dia pea it emp a and didnt care
about du t too boa use probably by that time he had learned that there were three things and no more breathing pleasure darkness and
without money there could be no pleasure and without pleasure it would not even be breathing but mere protoplasmic inhale and collapse of blind un
organism in a darkness where light never began and he had the money because he knew that she knew that the money was the only
things he could coerce and smooth him into the barrier with when derby day came so die didn td are pinch him thore and she
knew he knew it so that maybe he even blackmailed her bought her off that way you give me the jack as i want it
and i won task why or what for yet or maybe she was so busy grooming him that she never thought of the money now
who probably never had had much time to remember it or count it or wonder how much there was in the intervals of the hating
and the being mad and so all to check him up about the money would be the lawyer he bon probably learned that the first
thing that he could goto his modi er and hold the lawyers feet to the fire anytime like the millionaire horse has only to come
in one time with a litt k ext m sweat on bit n and tomorrow he will have a new jock sure tii at s
who it would be the lawyer that lawyer with his private mad fes maler dll iona ii e to ferm who probably wasnt interested enough
in the money to see whether the heck s had any other writing on them when she signed the mr that lawyer who with bons
mother already plotting and planning mm tin ce before he could remember for that day whe u he should he translated quick into so much
rich and rotting dirt had already been plowing and plant mg and harvesting him and the mother both as if heal rm dy was that
lawyer who may i be had the secret drawer in the secret safe and the secret paper in h tay beach art with o elo

and you could maybe even have seen the question mark after it and the other words even daughter d aug ker daughter trail ir off
not because thinking tr d led off but on the contrary thinking stopping right still then backing up aik de and spreading like when you
lay a stick across a trickle of water spreading and rising do walla rot aid him in whatever place it was that heo a ld
lock the door to and sk quiet and subtract the money that bon was spending on his whores and his champagne fi rom what his
mother had and figure up how much would be left of it tomorrow and next month and next year or until s ut pen would
be good and ripe thinking about the good hd cash that bern was throw ii away on his horses and clothes and the champagne and
gambling and women would have known about the oct oro on and die left handed marriage long he f om the mother did even if
it had been any sox et maybe he even had a spy in the bedroom like he ste cx ns to have had in s
ut pens maybe he even ph m ted her said to himself like you do about ad be is he g in mito tmi kh
be ee a hau od s nei aud mj tis ta light block of some sorts oae cant get inside of anything that might have
a fence around u and only him to try to check it or as much as he dared and not getting fc r because he
knew too that all bon had to do was togo to his mother and the racehorse would have a gold eating troi h if he
wanted it and if the jock wasnt careful a new jockey too counting up the money figuring what he would net at this normal rate
over the next few years and meanwhile crucified between his two problems whether maybe what he ought to do was to wash his hands of
the s ut pen angle and cleanup what was left and light out fir texas except that whenever he thought about doing that he would
have to think about all the money that bon had already spent and that if he had only gone to texas ten years ago or
five years ago or even last year he would have made more so that maybe at night while he would waiting for the window to
begin to turn gray he would be like what aunt rosa said she was and he would have to deny that he breathed or maybe
wished he didnt except or that two hundred per cort times the intrinsic value every new years the water badd ng up f ibm the
stick and rising and reading about him steady and quiet as lhc and hit n sitting there in the actual white glare of d air
vo pnc e or second sight or fit idi in human mis fer tune and f of iy or whatever you want to call it
that was showing him not only what might happen but what was actually going to happen and him declining to believe it was going to
happen not because it had come to him as a vision b ttt because it would have to have love and honor and courage and
pride in it and believing it might happen not because it was logical and pos sf ele but because it would be the most unfortunate
thing for all c once med that could occ or and though you mold no mote have proved vice or virtue or monge or cq
wai dim to him vd lh icu it him the moving people than you could have proved death to him without showing him a corpse
he did be he vein misfortune because of that rigorous and arduous dusty eunuchs training which taught to leave mans goodluck and joys to god
v rho would in return surrender all li is miseries and follies and misfortunes to the lice and fleas of coke and lit de tom
and the old sabine they stared glared at one another it was s hr eve speaking though save for the slight d ije ference w
li ich the intervening degrees of latitude had inculcated in them differences not intone or pitch but of turns of phrase and usage of words
it might have been either of them and was in a sense both both thinking as one the voice which happened to bespeaking the thought
only the thinking become audible vocal the two of them creating between them out of the ragtag and bob ends of old tales and talking
people who perhaps had never existed at all anywhere who shadows were shadows not of flesh and blood which had lived and died but shadows
in turn of what were to one of them atleast tosh re ve shades too quiet as the visible murmur of their vaporizing breath the
chimes now began to ring for midnight melodious slow and faint beyond the closed the snow sealed window the old sabine who couldnt to save
her life have told you or the lawyer or bon or anybody else probably what she wanted expected hoped for because she was a woman
and didnt need to want or hope or expect anything but just to want and expect and hope and besides your father said that when
you have plenty of good strong hating you dont need hope because the hating will be enough to nourish you the old sabine not so
old yet but she would have just let herself go in the sense that you keep the engines clean and oiled and the best of
coal in the bt m kers but you dont bother to shine the bright work or holy stone the decks a ay mote just let
herself goon the outside not fe td be would bum it up too fast for that shrivel it away in the gullet between swallowing and
stomach no pleasure in the chewing having to chew just another nuisance like no pleasure in the clothing having the old wear out and having
to choose the new just another nuisance and no pleasure in the is ne figure he neither of them said bon cut in the fine
pants that fit his leg and the fine coats that fit his shoulders nor in the fact that he had more watches and cuff buttons
and finer linen and horses and yd low vd we led buggies not to mention the gals than most others did but all that too
just an unavoidable nuisance that he would have to g shut of before he could do her any good just like he had to get
shut of the teething and die chickenpox and the light boys bones in order to be able to do her any good the old sabine
getting the faked reports from the lawyer like report stout back to headquarters from a bat def iron t with maybe as pedal in the
lawyers anteroom to do nothing else but carry diem and that maybe once in two years or five times in two days depending on when
she would begin to itch for news and began to worry him the report he communique about how we are not far behind him s
ut pen in texas or missouri or maybe california cali fia mia would be fine that r away convenient proof inherent in the sheer distance
the necessity to acc t and believe and we are going to catchup wi di him any day now and so do not worry so
she wo ul she wouldnt worry at all she would just have out the carriage and goto the lawyer busting in in the black dress
that looked like asec rion of limp stovepipe and maybe not even a hat but just a shawl otho head so that the only things
mf eing would he the mop and the pail bus dn gm and saying he s dead i know he is dead and how can
he how can he he not meaning what the aunt ro same a atwt me did they find ori ment a bullet that could kill
him but how cfl he he allowed to die wit it out hain ng to admit dia the was wrong and suffer and regret it
and so in t bene jct two seconds they would almost cat cb him he the lawyer would show her he actual letter the writing
in the tng l kh she couldnt read that had just come in that he had just sra it for the to carry to her
when she came in and the lawyer done practised putting d he nec e is ary date on the letter until he could do it
now wh ikh h bade would be toward her in the two seconds it would take him to get the letter out of the file
catch him get so close to him as to have ample satisfaction tih a the was alive so close indeed that he would be able
together out of the office before she had s at down and into the carriage again and on die way home again where among heh
orca ian e mirrors and paris drapes and tufted camisoles she would stil i look like die one hat had come into scrub the floors
in the black dress that die cook wouldnt have looked at even when it was new five or she years ago holding dutch ing the
letters he couldnt read maybe the only word in it she could even recognize would be he words ut pen in one hand and brushing
back a rope of lank iron colored hair with the other and not lo old bg at the letter like she was lead big it
even if die could have but swooping at it blazing down at it as if she knew she would have only a second to read
it in only a second for it to remain intact in after her eyes would touch it before it took fixe and so wo um
not be p em sed but consumed leaving her lifting there with a black crumbling blank carbon a shi niter hand and him nd the
r of them said bona er watching hex who had got olden oi gh ic have ka coed that what he thou was chl y
hood wm td bf ld hood that other children bad been made by others and mothers where be ii ad been created new when he
began to renumber new again when he came to the point where his carcass quit bd nga baby and became a boy new again when
he quit being a boy and became a man created between a lawyer and a woman whom he had thought was feeding and washing and
putting him to bed and find mg him in the extra dd dings for his palate and his pleasure because he was himself until he
got big enough to find out that it wasnt him at all she was wadi ing and feeding the candy and the fun to but
it was a mandi at had nt even arrived yet whom even she had never seen yet who would be something else beside that boy
when he did arrive like the dynamite which destroys the house and the fem ii y and maybe even the whole community a in t
the old peace fi il paper that maybe would rather be blowing aimless and light along the wind or the old merry sawdust or the
old quiet chemicals that had rather be still and dark in the quiet earth like they had been before the meddling guy with ten power
spectacles came and dug them up and strained warped and kneaded them created between this woman and a hired lawyer the woman who since be
fer e he could remember he now realized had been planning and grooming him fer some moment that would come and pass and fellow ij
gw hid i he saw that to her he would bel it de more than so much rich rotting dirt the lawyer who since hdf
ere he could remember he now realized had been plow ii and planting and watering and manuring and har v ting him as if ik
already was and bon watching her lounging the regain st the man tdi maybe in t be fine do the s in the harem incense
odor of what you might call easy san c ttt jr watching her looking at die letter not even thinking imho king upon my mother
since if the hating was ned ne she had worn it long aio tno yr fear it to dod koffice of cfc thing like they
say that mod b sty cm do lk s so he went away he went away to school at the age of twenty eight and
he wouldnt known or care about that either which of them mother or law jer it was who decided he should goto school nor why
because he had known all the time that his mother was up to some th mg and that the lawyer was up to something and
he didnt care enough about what either of them was to try to find out who knew that the lawyer knew that his mother was
up to something but that his mother didnt know that the lawyer was up to something and that it would be all right with the
lawyer if his mother got whatever it was she wanted provided he the lawyer got what he wanted one second before or atleast at the
sametime h fe went away to school he said all right and told the oct oro on goodbye and went to school who not in
all the twenty eight years had ever been told by anyone do as these others do have this task done at nine sum tomorrow or
friday or monday maybe it was even the oct oro on whom they or the lawyer used the light block not tether which the lawyer
had put on him to keep him om getting inside of some th h which might be found to have a fence around it later
maybe the mother found out about the oct oro on and the child and the ceremony and discovered more than the lawyer had or would
believe who considered bon only dull not a fool and sent for him and he came and lounged against the mantel again and maybe knowing
what was up what had happened before she told him lounging there with an expression on his face you might call smiling except it was
not that but just something you couldnt see through or past and she watching him with maybe the lank iron colored strand of hair down
agn n and not even bothering to brush it back now because she was not looking at any letter now but her eyes bla zi
cg a th hn her voice tty kg to bla aes ft him out of the urgency of sd at me a x but manning
to keep it do xvii since she could not talk about betrayal because she had not told him yet and now at this moments he
would not dare risk i the looking she rom behind the smiling that wasnt smiling but was just something you were not supposed to see
beyond saying admitting it it y not all young men do it the ceremony too i didnt set out to get the du ld but
now that i have it sik jt a bad child either and she watching him glaring at him and not being able to say what
she would because she had pu to if too long now saying what she could but you this is di fie rent and he she
would not need to say i the would know because he already knew why she had sent for him even if he did not know
and did not care what she had been up to since before he could remember since before he could take a woman whether in love
or not why not men seem to have to marry someday sooner or later and this is one whom know who makes meno trouble and
with the ceremony that bother already done and as for a litt k matter like a spot of blood not n ding to talk much
say much either not needing to say i seem to have beet i horn into this world with so few fathers that i have too
many bre vier s to ott if age and shame while alive and hence too many descendants to bequeath my ut de portion of hm
t and ham to dead not that just a little spot of blood and then to watch the face the desperate urgency and fear then
to depart kiss it tg her maybe her hand maybe which t would lie in his and even touch hh lips h kea dead hand
because of the desperate casting for this straw or that maybe as he wait on t be s dd she will goto him the lawyer
if i were to wait five mk ute si and dx e her in the i haw lso pro hi aly by tonight i will
bee hk is hm of i cored to htm jy be by night he did wybe be fot eth iu if they managed to find
him word to hum he can se she went to the lawyer and it was ri in the lawyers alley maybe before she even got
started telling it good that gentle white glow began like when you turn up a wick maybe he could even almost see his handwriting on
into the space where the daughter daughter daughter never had quite showed because maybe that had been the lawyers trouble and worry and concern all
the time that ever since she had made lin promise he would never tell bon who his father was he had been waiting and wondering
how to do it since maybe he knew that if he were to tell bonbon might believe it or he might not but certainly he
would go and tell his mother that the lawyer had told him and then he the lawyer would be sunk not for any harm done
because there would be no harm since this could not alter tie situation but for having crossed his paranoia cdi ent maybe while he would
s it in his office add ir and subtract it the money and add mg what they would get out of s ut pen was
never worried about what bon would do when he found out he had probably along rime ago paid bon that compliment of thinking that even
if he was too dull or too indolent tx suspect or find out about his ff it her himself he wasnt fool enough not to
be able to take adv ant of it once somebody showed him the proper move maybe if the thou gi ht had ever occurred to
him dat because of love or honor or anything else under heaven or jurisprudence either bon would not would refuse to he the lawyer would
even have furnished proof that he no loiter breathed maybe all the time it was this th attacked him how to get bon where he
would either have to find it out himself or wh somebody the her or the mot ii er would have to tdl him so maybes
lw wasnt out of the office good or at feast as soon as he had had rina e to open the safe and look m
the kcr et drawer and make sure that it was the oo iver at y that henry attended be fia rehash and was writing steady
and even into the space where the daughter daughter daughter never had showed and bri th the date here too isp two children say i
years increase times intrinsic pal yearly plus liquid assets plus credit earned approx up ali query bigamy threat yes or no possible no incest threat
credible yes and the hand going back fe fore it put down the period lining out the credible writing in certain underlining it and he
didnt care about that too he just said all right because maybe he knew now that his modi er didnt know and never would know
what she wanted and so he couldnt beat her maybe he had learned from the oct oro on that you cant beat women anyhow and
tb at if you are wise or dislike trouble and uproar you dont even try to and he knew that all the lawyer wanted was
just the money and so if he just didnt make the mistake of believing tba the could beat all of it if he just remembered
to be quiet and be alert he could beat some of it so he said all right and le this mother pack the fine clothes
and the fine linen into the bags and trunks and maybe he lounged into the lawyers office and watched from hi in d that something
which could have been called smiling while the lawyer made the elbow motion about getting his horses on to the steamboat and maybe buying him
an extra special body servant and arran g about the money and all watching from behind the smiling while the lawyer did the heavy father
even talking about the kho lar ship the culture the latin and the greek that would equip and polish him for the position which he
would hold in life dhow a man to be sure could get that anywhere in his own library even who had the will but how
there was sac nun g some quality to culture which only the monastic the doi al monotony of a say obscure and small though hi
cas high c lms ccd li and he aedt her of them po said bonn eva at anytime did there seem to be any confusion
between them as to whom s hr eve meant by he listening courteous and quiet behind that expression which you were not supposed to see
pasta sid ng at last interrupting maybe courteous and affable nothing of irony nothing of sarcasm what did you say this college was e and
now a good deal of elbow motion here while the lawyer would shuffle through the papers to find the one f iom which he could
read that name which he had been memorizing ever since he first talked to the mother the university of mississippi at where did you say
oxford quentin said its about forty miles from oxford and then the papers could be still again because he would be talking about a small
college only ten years old about how there wouldnt be anything to distract him from his studies there where in a sense wisdom herself would
be a virgin or atleast not very secondhand and how he would have a chance tool serve another and a provincial section of the country
in which his high destiny was rooted ranted the outcome of this war wh kh was without doubt it rit nine nt the successful conclusion
of which we all hoped for had no doubt of as the man he would be and the economic power he would represent when his
mother passed on and he listening behind that esc press ion saying then you dont recommend the la was avocation and now for just a
moment the lawyer would stop but not long maybe not long enough or perceptible enough for you to call it pause and he would be
looking at bon too it had nt occurred tome that the law mh t appeal to you and bonn either did practising with a rapier
appeal tome while i was doing it but i can retail atleast one occasion in my life when i was glad i had and then
the lawyer smooth and easy then by all mm s let it be the law your mother w if iii a gbe pleased all right
he said not goodbye he didnt care maybe he didnt even say goodbye to the oct oro on to those tears and lamentations and maybe
even the dinging the soft despairing mio lia colored arms about his ime es and say three and a half feet above dose boneless steel
g yves that expression of his which was not smiling but just something not to be seen through because you cant beat them you just
flee and thank god you can flee can cape fi rom that mass y five foot thick maggot cheesy solidarity which overlays the earth in
which men and women in couples ate ranked and racked like ninepins dx ank s to whatever gods for that masculine hip less tapering peg
which fits light and glib to move where the cart rid gfr ham be red hips of women hold them fast not goodbye all right
and one night he walked up the gangplank between de torches and probably only de lawyer dc re to see him off and this not
for go deed but to mesure that he actually took de boat and de new extra opening de bags in de stateroom spread it defined
odes and de ladies d ready gade red in de saloon for supper and de men in debar pr qa ring for it but no
the he alone at derail w ida car maybe watching de city drift and wink and glitter and sink away and den all motion cease
de boat suspended immobile and wi d out progress from de stars themselves by de two ropes of ark fill cd smoke streaming upward from
the stacks and who knows what thinking what sober weighing and discarding who had known for years that his mode r was up to something
that the lawyer was up to something and doth he knew that was just money ye the knew that within im lawyers known masculine limitations
he de lawyer could te almost as dangerous as de unknown quantity which was his mode rand now this a do ol college and he
twenty cbr years oh and not tad yd at but th h particular collie w hid the had never heard of which tea years jo
did not even ad stand knowing too that it was the lawyer who had chosen it for him what sober w has intent what almost
frowning why why why i is colt e get his particular one above all others maybe leaning the in that solitude between panting smoke and
eth and almost touching the answer aware of the jigsaw puzzle picture te gers of it waiting almost lurking just beyond his reach inextricable jumbled
and unrecognizable yet on the point of failing into pattern which would reveal to him at once like a flash of light the meaning of
his whole life past the haiti the chi lc i ood the lawyer the woman who was his mother and maybe the letter itself right
there trader lus feet somewhere in the darkness beneath the de dk on which he stood the letter addressed not to thomas s utp e
natsu t pens hundred but to h fen ry s ut pen esquire in reade ace at the uni vc tsi ty of mississippi near
oxford miss ssi ppl one day he ruy showed it to him and there was no gentle reading glow but a flash a glare showed
it to him who not only had no visible fet her but had found himself to be even in infancy en dosed by a nun
sleeping cabal bait apparently on tea di ing him that he had never had af ether that his mother had emerged from a sojourn in
limbo from that state of blessed amnesia in which the weak senses can take refuge from the godless dark force and powers which weak human
fl cfl i cannot stand to wake pc nant shriek i ug and screaming and thrashing not against the ruthless agony of labor but it

and he a hand die youth noi would want him to be older than me and he no son of a landed father wants an
older brother and the youth yes ido looking straight at the other the esoteric the sybarite stanch ng the youth now erect thin because he
was young his face scarlet but his head ii gh and his eyes steady yes and i would want him to be just like you
and he b that so the whiskeys your side drink or pass and now s hr eve said were going to talk about love but
he didnt need to say that either anymore than he had needed to specify which he meant by he since neither of them had been
thinking about anything else all that had gone before just so much that had to be over passed and none else present to overpass it
but them as someone always has to rie the leaves up before you can have the bonfire that was why it did not matter to
dither of them which one did the talking since it was not the talking alone which did it performed and accomplished the over passing hut
some happy marriage of speaking and hearing where in each before the demand the requirement forgave condoned and forgot the faulting of the other fi
iu id ngs both in the creating of this shade whom they discussed ra her existed in and in hearing and s if h ng
and discarding he fils e and con r ving what seemed true or fit the p recon cd ved in order to overpass to love
where here might be paradox and in con as tea cy but nothing fault nor fi he and now love he must hawk nc fw

that ev m men of the family were not supposed to know a gro a deal about he must have learned it without even having
to aska single question jesus it must have kind of boi k d out all over him there must have be m nights and nights
while henry was learning from him how to lounge about a bedroom in a gown and slippers such as women wore in afr in t
though unmistakable ef flu vi um of scent such as women used smoking a cigar almost as a woman might smoke it yet withal such
an air of indolent and lethal assurance th n only the most reckless man would have g mu it ou sly drawn the comparison and
with no attempt to teach train p ky the mentor on his part and then maybe yes maybe who could know what time she looked
at henry s free and thought not there but for the intervening leaven of th a blood w l mk we dot wt have m

the sai speech and mannerisms was but the shell thinking u dust cot mot ido with this willing fes hand bone if i wish dt
is flesh and bone and s pki tw hid t stemmed fr mn the same source that mine did but which sprang in quiet peace
and content me fit and ran in steady eventhough monotonous sunlight where that which he bequeathed me sprang in hatred and outrage and unforgiving and
ran in shadow what could i not mold of this malle s le and eager clay which that father himself could not to what shape
of what good there might must he in that blood and none handy to take and mold that portion of it in until too late
or what moments when he might have to h himself that it was nonsense it could not be true lh at such coincide nas only
happened in hooks thinking the wariness the fatalism the incorrigible cat for solitude that young clodhopper bastard how s hdl i get rid of him
and then the voice the other voice you dont mem that and he no but ido mem the clodhopper bastard and die days the afternoons
while they rode to get hor and henry aping him here too who vm the better hms em an who maybe had nothing of what
bon would have called style but who had done more of it to whom a hors was as natural as walking v dio would ride
anything anywhere and at anything while he must have watched himself being swamped and submerged in the bright unreal flood of henry s s pea
h translated the three of them himself and henry and the sister whom he had never seen and perhaps did not even have any cu
rice it y to see into aw odd like a fli iry tale in which nothing else save them existed riding beside henry listening needing
to ask no questions to prompt to farther spore h in any manner that youth who did note vm suspect that he and the man
beside him might be brothers who each time his breath a os sed his vocal chords was saying from now on mine and my sisters
house will hey sm house mine emd my sisters lives your life wondering bon or maybe not wondering at all how if cond it io
as were reversed and in ry was dies trango and he bondi escu m and sds k nie ww h fu the suspected if he
would say the same th mb on a gimn gat last saying at last all right ill come home with yon for christmas not to
see the third inhabitant of henry s iry tale not to see the sister because he had not on i thought of her he had
merely listened about her but tbm in ng so at last is hall see him whom it seems i was bred up never to expect
to see who mi had even learned to live with mt thinking maybe how he would walk into the house and see the man who
made him and then he would know them would be that flash that instant of indisputable recognition ic tween them and he would know for
sore and forever thi joking maybe that sdl iwan the need not even acknowledge mei will let him understand just as ju ick ly that
he need not do that thai do not expect that will tw t be hurt by that just as he will let me know that
qu u my that it un his son dunking maybe maybe again with that expression you might call smiling but which was not wh idi
was just some di ing that even just a dod hopper bastard was not intended to see beyond iam my motes son atleast ido not
seem to know what i want eid ter knew exactly what he wanted it was just the saying of it the physical touch even thou
g ji insane t hidden the living touch of that fled i warmed bor che was bom by the same blood which it had b
uea died him to warm his own flesh with to be bequeathed by him in tom to run hot and loud in veins and limbs
after that first flesh and then his own were dead so the christmas came and he and henry rode the forty m fles tosu t
pens hundred with henry s tiu talking sail keeping distended and light and iridescent with steady breathing that fairy balloon vacuum in which the three
of them existed lived moved even maybe in without f le fli faun self and the f ii end and the sister whom the f
ii end had never seen and though henry did not know it bad not even thought about yet but only k ste ned about fi
rom behind the more urgent thinking and t henry probably not even no a eing that the nearer they came to home the less bon
talked had to say on any sub jea and maybe even and certainly henry would not know this listening less and so he wait into
the house and maybe somebody looking at him would have seen on his ce an expression a good deal like the one that prof l
feting with humility yet with pride too of complete surrender which he had used to see on henry sf ece and maybe he telling himself
in o im ly dont know what it is i want but apparently lama good deal younger than i thought also and saw face to
face die man who might be his father and not hmg happened no shock no hot communicated flesh that speech would have be a i
too slow even to impe nothing and he spent ten days there not only the esoteric the sybarite the steel blade in the silken tess
ella ted sheath which henry had begun to a peat the univers hy but the object of art the mold and mirror of form and
foo nw hid is utp enso your father said accepted him as and insisted didnt your father say that it e and would have purchased
him as and paid for him with judith even if there had be oi no other bidder am cmg the four of them or didnt
your father say and which he did lana into hoc until he disappeared taking henry with him and she never saw him again and war
and trouble and grief and bad food filled her days until maybe she didnt even ron ember after a while that she had ever forgot
him and the girl the aster the virgin jesus who to know what she s iw that afi et noon when they rode up the
drive what prayer what maida i meditative dream ridden up out of whatever feb u io usl and not in harsh stove iron but die
silken and tragic in nc dot nearing thirty ten years older than she was and wearied sated wi fo what exp a ien ces and
pleasures which hairy s letters must have created for her and the day came to t fe pate and nosy e the and henry rot
fe away and still no sign no more sign at parting than when he hs d seen it first in that fac where he might
he would believe have seal for himself the truth and so would have needed no sign if it had nt been for the beard no
sign in the eyes which could see his ce because there was no beard to hide it could have seen the truth if it were
there yet no flicker in rh em and so he knew it was in his fare because he knew that the other had seen it
th a e just exactly as henry was to know the next christmas eve m the library that his father was not lying by the
fact that the father said nothing did nothing maybe he even thought wondered if perhaps that was not why the beard if maybe the other
had not hidden behind that bear dag dns t this very day and if so why why thinking but why why since he wanted so
little could have u nden too d if the other had wanted the sig to be in secret would have been quick and glad to
let it be in secret even if he could not have understood why thinking in the middle of this my god am young young m
di didnt even h now it they didnt even tdl me that i was young f reh ng that same da pair and shame like
when you have to watch your father fei lin physical course thinking it d toul d have been me that f aik d mei no
the who stemmed f iom that b too dw hk ji we both bear before it could have become ex m up t md tainted
by whatever it was in w of feer s that he could not brook waits hie veer k d hough quentin had not spoken it
had been merely some q oak ty some gathering of quentin s still l axed and hunched figure which presaged speech brea uses hr eve
said wait wait before quentin co um have begun to speak because he had nt even looked he roh he had s ren her all
ri the had had plenty of opportunity for that he could not have helped but that because mrs s ut pen would have seen to
it ten days df that kind of planned and arranged and exe em to dpa vada like the camp aps d dead gen orals in
he tex hod binh br aries and parlors and drives in the buggy in the afternoons all planned three months ago when mrs s ut
pen read henry s first letter with sons name in it until maybe even judith too began to feel hk e the other one to
a pair of goldfish and him even talking to her too or what talking he could have found to do to a country girl who
probably never saw a man young or old before who sooner or later didnt smell like manure talking to her about like he would talk
to the old dame on the gold chairs in the parlor except that in the one case he would have to make all the conversation
and in the other he would not even be able to make his own escape but would have to wait for henry to come and
get him and maybe he had even thought about her by that time maybe at the times when he would be telling himself it amt
be so he could not look at me like this everyday and make no sign if it were so he would even tell himself she
would be easy like when you have left the champagne on the supper table and are walking toward the whiskey on the sideboard and you
happen to pass a cup of lemon sherbet on at ray and you look at the sherbet and tell yourself that would be easy too
only who wants it does that suit you but its not love quentin said because why not because listen what was it the old dame
the aunt rosa told you about how there are something s that just have to be whether they are or not have to be a
damn sight more than some other things that maybe are and it dont matter a damn whether the yate or not that was i the
just didnt have time yet jesus he must have known it would be like that lawyer drought he wasnt a fool the trouble was he
wt the kind of not fool the lawyer tho ih the would be he must have known it was going to happen it would be
like you passed that sherbet and maybe you knew you would event each the a de board and whiskey yet you knew that to moi
row morning you would want that sherbet dien you reached the wh i ey and you knew you wanted that sherbet now maybe you didnt
even goto the sideboard maybe you even looked back a that champagne on the supper table among the dirty h avil and and the crumpled
damask and all of a sudden you knew you didnt want togo back there even it would be no question of choosing having to choose
between the champagne or whiskey and the sherbet but all of as uh knit would be spring then in that country where he had never
spent a spring before and you said north mississippi is a little harder country than louisiana with dogwood and violets and he early scentless flowers
but the ear hand the nights still a little cold and the hard tight sticky buds like young girls nipples on alder and judas trees
and beech and ma q le and even some t bing young in the cedars like he never awb ere you find that you dont
want anything but that sherbet and that you have nt been wanting any tfa kg dse but that and you have been wanting that pretty
hard for sometime besides knowing that that she rbi is there for you to take not jur t for anybody to take but for you
to take knowing just from looking at that cup that it would be like a flow ff that if any other hana reached for it
it would have thorns on it but not for your hand and him not used to that s mee all the other cups fh at
had boon willing and easy for him to take up hadn to t mta in eddie r bet but champ a e or at hast
kitchen wine and more than that there was the knowing what he suspected mh t be so or not knowing if it was so or
not and who to say if it wasnt maybe the po b flit y of incest because v ho without a asterid on t know
about the others has been in love and not discovered the vain evanescence of the fleshly ei u to unter vd ho has not had
to realize that when the brief all is done you must retreat firm n both love and pleasure gad x op you rot m rubbish
and ref o the hats and pants and shoes which you drag through the world and retreat since the gods condone and practise the and
the dreamy i mme asura bk coupling which float so bk vio us above the tram eling and hani ed instant the was not is
was is a perquisite only of balloon y and weigh des s elephants and whales but maybe if there were s in too maybe you
would not be permitted to escape uncouple return a in t that right the ceased he could have been interrupted easily now quentin could have
spoke now but quentin did no the just s at as before his hands in his trousers pc xi ets his shoulders hugged m ward
and hunched his face lowered and he looking somehow curiously smaller than he actually was because of his actual height and spareness that quality of
delicacy about the bones articulation which even at twa it y still had something about it some last echo about it of adolescence that is
as compared wi di the cherubic burliness of the odi er who b xxi him who looked younger whose very superiority in bulk and displacement
made him look ev m younger as a plump boy of twelve who out we hs the other by twenty or th k ty pounds
still looks younger dian the boy of fourteen who had that plumpness cm ce and lost it sold it whether with his consent or not
fr that state of v irn it y which is neither boys nor girls i dont know quentin said all rig lt ts hr eves
a icl maybe i dont either only jk us someday you are bound to fell in love they just wouldnt beat you that way it
would be like if god h tid got jesus bom and saw that he had the carpenter tools and the nne vex gave him any
th ii to build with d jem dont you beh we that sidon t know qt antin said h fe did not mow sir eve
jo db at km even while they mre not talking these bre atl is in the tomb like air vapor id gently and quietly t
be chimes for midnight would have rung sometime ago now you mean it dont matter to you quentin did not answer that s right dont
say it be cat is ei would know you a rely ii all right then listen because he never had to worry about the love
because that would take care of itself maybe he knew there was a fate a doom on him hk ewha the old aunt rosa told
you about something s that just have to be whether hey are or not just to balance the books write paid on the old sheet
so that whoever keeps them can tai it out of the ledger and bum it get rid of it maybe he knew hot that whatever
the oldman had done whether he meant well or ill by it it wasnt going to be the oldman who would have to pay the
check and now that the oldman was bankrupt with them com pet m ce of age who should do the paying not his sons his
get because wasnt it dc me that way in the old days the old abraham of years atul weak and incapable now of further harm
caught t last and the captains and the collect ots saying oldman we dont want you and abraham would say praise the lord have raised
about mesons to bear the burden of mine iniquities and persecutions yea perhaps even to restore my bock s and herds from the hand of
therav is her that imh t rest mine eyes upon my goods and chattels upon die genera ric ms of them and of my dsc
end ants increased an hundredfold as my soul goeth out from me he knew all the time that the low w did d take cate
of itself maybe that was why he didnt have to think about her during those three months between that september and that christmas while henry
talked a hom her to him saying everytime he breathed jef ers and mfi he s me to exist wi dm and upon yours did
not need to waste anytime ova the love after it happened backfired on him why he never b he red to wr keh a any
letters esc ce pt that last onew hid is he would want to save why he never actually proposed to it er and gave he
raring form rss ut pen to show around because the fate was on her too the same old abraham who was so old and weak
now nobody would want him in the flesh on any debt maybe he didnt even have to wait for that christmas to see her to
know tins maybe that s what it was that came out of the three months of henry stalking that he heard without listening to iam
not hearing e hot tia young girl a virginia m hearing about a narrow delicate fenced virgin field already furrowed and bedded so that all
is hall need to do is drop the seeds in caress it smooth again saw her that christmas and knew it for certain and then
forgot it went back to school and did not even remember that he had forgotten it because he did not have time then maybe it
was just one day in that spring you told about when he stopped and said right quiet all rig h li want togo to bed
with who might be my sister all right and then forgot that too because he didnt have time that is he didnt have anything else
but time ba use he had to wait but not for her that was all fixed it was the other maybe he thought it would
be in the mail bag each time the rode over from s ut pens hundred and henry b die ving it was the letter om
hertha the was w aid ng for when what he was tfa in kh was maybe he will write it then he would just have
to write tam your father bt m this and i would do it or if not that a sheet a scrap of paper with the
one word charles in his hand and i would hum what he meant and he would not even have to ask me to bumi torah
dt of his hair or a paring from his fingernail rm di would know d tem because i believe now that i have known what
his hair and us fingernails would look like all my life could dio os e that lode and tu it paring out of a thousand
and it did not come and his letter went to her every two weeks and her s came back to him and maybe he th
oi if one of mm to her s hm dd comp back tome unopened then that would be as i and tli at didnt lia
ppen and then henry began to talk about his stopping at s ut pens hundred for a day or soon his way home and he
said all right to it said it will be henry who will get the letter the letter saying it is inconvenient forme to come at
that time so apparently he does not intend to acknowledge me as b is son but atleast is hall have forced him to admit that
iam and that one did not come either and the date was set and the family at s ut pens hundred notified of it and
that letter did not come either and he thought it will he then i wronged him may bet kb is what he has been waiting
for and maybe his heart sprang then maybe he said yes yes i will renounce her i will renounce love and all that will be
cheap cheap eventhough he say tome never lookup on my face again u dee my hue and my acknowledgement in secret md goi will do
that i will net t even demand to hio w of him what it was my mod m did that jt ttt if i ed
his action toward her and meso the day came and he and hairy rode the forty miles again into the gates and up the drive
to the house he knew what would be there the woman whom he had seen once and seen through the girl whom he had seen
through without even having to see once the man whom he had seen daily watched out of his fearful intensity of need and had never
penetrated the mother who had taken hm cy aside before they had been six hours in the house on that christmas visit and in fi
ir med him of the en ge mental most be re the fiance had had time to associate the daughters name with the daughters fi
ice so that probably before they even reached school again and without his be ii aware that he had dc a ie so henry had
already told bon what was in his mothers mind who had already told bon what was in his so that maybe before they ev on
started on sons so cond visit t would he june now and what woo mi the in ntt rth mbs is sip pit w tev
mit you said s the magnolias in bloom and the mockingbirds and in fifty years more after they had gone and fought it and lost
it and comeback home e deco ratio a day and die veterans in the neat brushed hand ironed gray and the spurious bronze medals that
never meant anything to be gm with and the chc nen young girls in white dresses bound at the waist with crimson sashes and the
band would play db de and all the old doddering men would yd l that you would not have thought would have had wind enough
to get there walk downtown to s it on the rostrum even it would be june now with the moli as and mockingbirds in the
moonlight and the curtains blowing in the june air of commencement and the music fiddles and triangles inside among the swirling and dipping hoops and
henry would beal it de tight that should have been saying i demand to know your intentions toward my sister but wasnt saying it instead
maybe blushing again even in the moonlight but standing straight and blushing because when you are proud enough to be humble you dont have to
cringe who every tink he breathed over his vocal chords he was saying we belong to you do as you will with us saying i
used to think that i would hate the man that would have to look at everyday and wh cm see very move and action and
sj mh would say to mei have seen and touched parts of your sisters body that you will never see and touch and now i
know that is hall hate him and that s why i want that man to you knowing that bon would know what he meant was
trying to say tell him thinking telling himself henry not just he a mx he is older dum iam and has known more than is
hdl ever hum radha sw net tae red more of it but because of my own five will if t td whether i knew u
at dte time or not does not matter i gave my ufc and judi dd s both to him that s not b ve quentin
said all rights hr eve said just listen they rode the forty miles and into the gates and op to die house and this times
ut pen wasnt evo i there and ellen didnt even know where he had gone believing blandly and volubly that he had gone to memphis
or maybe even to saint louison basins and hsi ry and judith not even caring that much and only he bon to know where s
ut pen had gone saying to himself of course he wasnt sure he had togo there to make sure telling himself that loud now loud
and fast too so he would not could not hear the thinking the but if he suspected why no th we told mei would have
done that gone to him first who have the blood fier it was tainted and corrupt by whatever it was in mother loud and fast
now telling himself that s what it is maybe he has gone on ahead to wait forme hel no message forme here because dte others
are not suspect yet whe knows i wt will know at once where he is when j f is d him g me thinking of
the two of them the so mba vengeful woman who was his mother and the grim rod dike man who had looked at him everyday
for ten days with ab sol ut diy no alter a tian of expression at all faring one another in grim armistice after almost thirty
yea is in that rich baroque drawing room in that house which he called homes in ux apparently everybody seemed to have to have a
home the man whom he was now sure was his father not humble now either and he bon proud of that not saying even now
i was wrong hut i admit that it is so jk us think of hds heart then during those two days with die old gal
throw i eg judith at hume very minute now because she had been s pre ang the news of the enga ment confidentially through die
county ever since christina s didnt your father say how she had even taken judith to memphis in the spring to buy the t rousse
ant and judith nei die rha vii g to acc e to the throw i rg nor to resist it but just being just existing
and breathing like henry did who maybe one morning during that spring waked up and lay right still in the bed and took stock added
the figures and drew the balance and told himself all right iam trying to make myself into what i think he wants me to be
he can do anything he wants to with me he has only to tell me what to do and i will dou eventhough what he
asked me to do looked tome like dishonor i would still do it only judith being a female and so wiser than that would not
even consider dishonors he would just say all right i will do anything he might ask me to do and dt at is why he
will never ask me to do anything that ie on d der dishonor meso db at maybe he even kissed her that time the first
time she had ever been kissed maybe and she too innocent to be coy or modest or even to know that she had been temporized
with maybe afterward just looking at him wi dia kind of peaceful and blank surprise at the fact that your sweetheart appa rend y kissed
you the first time like your brother would provided of course that your brother ever thought of could be brought to kissing you on the
mouth so that when the two days were up and he was gone again and elk n shrieking at her what no engagement not roth
no rings he would be too astonished even to lie a bot u it because that would be the first time it would have occurred
to her that there had been no proposal ih ink of his heart then while he rode to the river and the non the steamboat
itself where he walked up and down the deck feeling through the deck the aig in es driving him nearer and nearer day and night
to the moment which he must have realized now he had been waiting forever since he had got big a a ough to comprehend of
co une every now and dio i he would have to say it pretty fast and loud that s all it is he wants to
make sure first to drown out the old but why do it a is u tay why not back there he d mows that shall
never m dte my claim u yen my part of what he now possesses gamed at the price of what sacrifice and endurance and scorn
so they told meno the they only he htm s knows that so well di at it would never have o cam to him just
as he knows it would never occur tome that this might he his reason who is not only generous but ruthless who must have surrendered
everything he and mod ter owned to her and tome as the price of repudiating her not because the doing it this way hurt him
flouted him and kept him in suspense that much unnecessary longer because he didnt matter whether he was irked or even crucified didnt matter it
was the fact that he had to be kept constantly reminded that he would not have done it th h way himself ye the had
stemmed from the blood after whatever it was his mother had been or done had tainted and corrupted it nearer and nearer until suspense and
puzzlement and haste and all seemed blended into one sublimation of passive surrender in which he thought only ar rig hl all right even this
way even if he wants to do it dt is way uh ll pron a x never to see hai a in neva to see
him again i hen he reached home and he never learned if s ut pen had been there or no the never knew he believed
it but he nev ark new his mother the same somber un chan golf i or ce paranoia c whom he had lef i in
september fi rom whom he could le am nothing by in d iibc tion and whom he dared not a outright the very fiu j
that he saw through the skillful questions of the lawyer as to how he had liked the school and the people of that country and
how perhaps or had he not perhaps hc had made f ii ends up there among the country fi uni lira only that much more
proof to him at that time that s ut pen had not been there or atleast the lawyer was not aware that he had an
cc now that he believed he had fathomed the lawyers design in sending him to that particular school to begin with he saw not li
ing in the questions to indicate that the lawyer had learned any di ing new since or what he cal d have learned i a
that interview with the lawyer because it would be a a or tone it would be next to the shortest one ever to transpire between
them the shortest one of all next to the last one of course the one which would occur in the next summer when henry would
be with him because the lawyer would not dare asking him outright just as he bon did not dare to ask his mother outright because
though the lawyer believed him to be rather a fool than dull or dense yet even he the lawyer never for one moment believed that
even bon was going to be the kind of a fool was going to be so he told the lawyer nothing and the lawyer told
hit ti nothing and the summer passed and september came and still the lawyer his mother too had not once asked him if he wanted
to return to the school so that atlas the had to say it himself that he intended to return and maybe he knew that he
had lost that move since there was nothing whatever in tik lawyers feces ave an agents acquiescence so he returned to school where henry was
waiting oh yes waiting for him who did not even say you didnt answer my let tm you didnt even write to judith who had
already said what n ty sister m di have and are belongs to you but maybe he did write to judith now by die first
post which rode tosu t pens hundred about how it had been a nun event fi il summer and hence nothing to write about with
maybe charles bon plain and in el ida bie on the outside of the en v dope and he thinking he will have to see
that maybe he will send it bade thinking maybe if it comes back nothing will stop med m and so maybe a last unit know
what iam going to do butt tdk j nt comeback and the others didnt comeback and the passed and christmas came and they rode again
tosu t pens hundred and this times ut pen was not there again he was in the field he had gone to town he was
hund is md nn gsn tcq not there when they rode up and bon knew ii e had not expected him to be there say
ii now now now if will com now u will com this tim and iam young young because i still dont know what iam going
to do so maybe what he was doing that twilight because he knew that su q en had returned was now in the house it
would be like a wind something dark and chill bread bing upon him and he stopping grave q met alert thinking nfl fw his it
thr a the would know he could fed the of e er entering the house and he would le this held breath go quiet and
s ya profound exhalation his heart quiet too in the garden while he walked with judith and talked to her gallant and dant and automatic
and judith thinking about that like she thought about that fim k back in the summer sod tats it that s what love is blue
one doi ux more by disappointment but still un bowed maybe what he was ing there now was waiting telling himself maybe even ye the
wm send format least say u tom eventhough he knew b men he is b tike library now he has sem the for hm ry
now he wy isch fei fw so that maybe he stopped aid fec her with something in his fec e that was sm ff ing
now and took ho by die elbows and turned her easy and gende until she faced the house and said go x wi to alone
to think about love and die went just as dte took the kiss that day with maybe the fed of the dat of hh hand
light and momentary upon her behind and he stood the ce fed ng the house until henry came out and they looked at one another
for a while with no word said and dien turned and walked to gd her through the garden across the lot and into tst aue
where na ay be tie was ani er there and may bed bey saddled the two boise s themselves and waited until ds house came
with the two re packed sadd dgs and maybe he didnt even say then but he sent n our or d to mets ht eve
ceased xh at is fer all the two them and qu end n knew he had stopped since for all the two of diem knew
he had never bun since it did not matter and possibly neither of them conscious of the distinction which one had been doing the talking
so that now it was not two but four of diem riding the two horses through the dark over the frozen december ruts of that
christmas eve four of them and then just two charles s hr eve and qu end n henry the two of them both believing that
henry was thinking he meaning his father has destroyed us all not for one moment thinking he meaning bon must have kno u morat lea
suspected this all the time that s why he has acted as he has why he did not answer my letters last summer nor write
to judith why he has never asked her to marry him believing that that must have occurred to hairy certainly during that moment after henry
emerged fi rom the house and he and bon looked at one a no die r for a while without a word then walked down
to the stable and saddled the horses but that e ten ry had just taken that in stride because he did not yet believe it
eva it hoth ikk new that it was true because he must have now unc kr stood with complete despair the secret of his wh
cde attitude toward bon fico m that first instinctive moment w hm he had seen him a year and a quarter o he knew ye
the did mot had to refuse to believe so it was four of them who rode the two horses through that night and dien across
the br ht fir ost y north mississippi christmas day in something t cry like pariah hood passing the plantation houses with s pri of
holly thrust beneath the knockers on the doors and mistletoe hang up fi rom the chandeliers and bow k of g nog and toddy on
tables in the balk and the blue unwind ed wood smoke standing above the plastered chimneys of the dave quartos to die river and the
steamboat there wot dd be christmas on the boat too the same holly and mkd cf ioe i the same and toddy pei has doubtless
a christmas supper and a ball but not for them the two of the mm the d uk and the cold standing at the guardrail
above the dark water and still not talking since dic re was nothing to say the two of them the four of them held in
that probation that suspension by henry who knew but still did not believe who was going deh berate ly to lookup on and prove to
himself that which sos hr eve and qu cn an believed would be like dead i for him to learn so it was four of
them still who got off the boat in new orleans which henry had never seen before whose entire cosmopolitan experience apart from his sojourn at
the school consisted probably of one or two trips to memphis with his father to buy livestock or slaves and had no time to look
at now henry who knew yet did not believe and bon whom mr comp son had called a fatalist but who according tosh re ve
and quentin did not resist henry s dictum and design for the reason that he neither knew nor cared what henry intended to do because
he lu td long since realized that he did not know yet what he himself was go ii to do four of them who satin
that drawing room of baroque and fusty magnificence which s hr eve had invented and which was probably true mou while the haiti bom daigh
ter of the french sugar plant ct and the woman whom s ut pens first f rtl kr in law h to la him was
a spaniard the slight dowdy woman with untidy gray streaked raven hair coarse as a horses tail with parchment colored skin and implacable pouched black
eyes which alone showed no age because they showed no foi getting whom s hr eve and quentin had likewise invented and w hid b
was likewise probably true enough told them nothing because she did not need to because die had already told it who did not say my
son is in love with your sistere b ttt so she has fallen in love with him and the as at latching hazily and st
sey at henry who could not have ik d to i we veni he would have who did not even have to answer at all
either yes or no four of them there in that room in new orleans in ido just as in a sense there were four of
them here in this tomb like room in massachusetts in and bon may have probably did take henry to call on the oct oro on
mistress and the child as mr comp son said tho ih neither s hr even or quentin believed that the visit affected henry as mr
comp son seemed to think in fact quentin did not even tells hr eve what his father had said about die visit perhaps quentin himself
had not been listening when mr comp son related it that evening at home perhaps at that moment on the gallery in the hot september
twilight quentin took that in stride without even hearing it just asic ve would have since both he and s hr eve believed and were
probably right in di is too that the oct oro on and the child would have bn to henry only something else about bon to
be not a i vied but aped if that had been possible if there had been time and peace to ape it in peace not
bet we a i men of the same race and nation but peace between two young embattled spirits and the incontrovertible fact which embattled them
since neither henry and bon anymore f hart quentin and s hr eve were the first young men to believe or atleast apparently acton the
as sump t ichi that wars were sometimes created for the sole aim of settling youths private difficulties and discontents so the old dame asked
henry that one question and th pts at there laigh ii gat him so he knew then they both knew and so now it would
be short this time with the lawyer the short kt one of all be cao to the law rer would have been watching him maybe
there had even been a letter dor tug that second while the lawyer was waiting and st ff lito thing seemed to bo happening diet
e and may bed be kw j w was the leas mi why bon never as we icd h bir s and judith sk tter
s dari i that summer because he never got the male o er two or maybe three pages of your humble and obe dim te
and t and c that boiled down tod gh teen words ihi ow you area foot but just what kind of a fool are you
going to he and bon was atleast enough of a not fool to do the boiling down yes wat dung him not concerned yet just
considerably annoyed giving bon plenty of time to come to him giving him of a week maybe after he the lawyer would have contrived to
get hold of henry and find ott ta good deal of what henry was thinking without henry ever knowing it before he would contrive bon
too and maybe so good at the contriving that even bon would not know at once what was coming it would be a short one
it would be no secret between them now it would just be unr said the lawyer behind dm desk and maybe in the secret draw
ee the ledger where he had just finished adding in lie last past years interest compounded between the intrinsic and the love and pride at
two hundred percent the lawyer fire t ted annoyed but not at all concerned since he not only knew he had the sc rev re
hu the still did not really believe that bon was that kind of afi ml though be was about to alter b is opinion somewhat
about the ddl ness or atleast the bad k ward ness die lawyer wat x img him and sayings mood i and oily ance it
would be no a x rct now who would know now that bon knew all he would ever know or would need to know to
make the coup do you know that you area very f is rta nate young man wh h most of us even when vre are
lud kye noi to get our revenge we must pay for it sometimes in actual dollars while you are not ca ilyin a position to
get your revenge dear your mothers name but the balm with wb kh you w ff l assuage her injury will have a col later
dva h ww hid i cm be tian si at into dm th a jg s wh kha young jn a a meds wh idi
ate his dc rar dvd ii ch whim r veli ls it or not maybe had only in exchange for hard dollars and bon not
saying what do you mean and not moving yet that is the lawyer would not be aware that he was beginning to move continuing the
lawyer smooth and easy and more than this than the revenge as lagniappe to the revenge as it were this nosegay of an afternoon this
scentless prairie flower which will not be missed and which might as well bloomin your lapel as in another s his how do you young
men put its l nice lit de piece and hen he would see bon maybe the eyes maybe he would just hear the feet moving
and then pistol derringer horse pistol revolver whatever it was and all he would be crouched back against the wall behind the overturned chair snarling
stand backstop then screaming help help ffc then just screaming because he would hear and feel his own wrenching bones before he could free his
fingers of the pistol and his neck bone too as bon would strike him with die palm on one cheek and then with the back
of the hand on the od wr maybe he could even he arbon too sayings to pithus kim not going to hurt you or maybe
it was the lawyer in him that said the hush w hid h he obeyed who got him back into the righted chair again half
lying upon the desk the lawyer in him that warned him not to say you will pay for this but instead to half lie thore
nursing his wrenched hand in his handkerchief while bon stood looking down at him holding the pistol by the barrel against his leg say ii
gt f you fed that you require satisfaction of course you know and the lawyer sitting back now dabbing the handke rdt uefa this cheek
now was wrong im is under md your fed ing about the matter i ask your pardon and n granted as you wish i will
a ox pt either a napol cy or a bullet as you prefer and the lawyer th would be a in tid hg red in
his chee h but that would be all nothing mt i he voice or in the eyes i see you are going to collect full
measure for my unfortunate misconception even ridicule even if if ht that right was on my side which ido not i would soil have to
decline your of lf eri would not be your equal with pistols and bonn or with knives or rapiers toot and the lawyer smooth and
easy nor knives or rapiers too so di at now the lawyer wouldnt even need to say you will pay for this because bon would
be say it that for him who would stand there with the lax pistol thinking but only with knives or pistols or rapiers so i
cant beat him i could shoot him i would shoot him with no more compunction than i would a snake or am at who cuckolded
me but he would still heat me thinking yeshe did beat me while he he listens hr eve said cried it would be whl e
he would belying in a bedroom of that private house in corinth a fier ht ts burg landing w hik his shoulder got well two
years later and die letter from the oct oro on maybe even the one that contained the photograph of her and the chi u finally
overtaking him wail mg for money and telling him that the lawyer had departed for texas or mexico or somewhere at last and that the
oct oro on could not find his mother either and so without do rh t the lawyer had murdered her before he stole the money
since it would be just like bod i of them to flee or get themselves killed without providing for her at all yes they knew
now and jesus think of him bon who had wanted to know who had had the mc reason to want to know who as far
as he knew had never bad any fa die r but had been c red so md bow between du two man who wouldnt let
him play with other child im and that lawyer who event old the woman whether or note adh time die ix iu a piet x
of meat or a loaf of bread two people neither of whom had ta km pleasure or found passion in get t mg him or
sulked pain acd travail in bc mo ing hint mw j bop e iii aps if one of the two had only told him the
truth none of what happened would ever have come to pass while there was henry who had father and security and con tenement and all
yet was told the truth by both of them while he bon was told by neither and think of henry who had said at first
it was a lie and then when he knew it was not a lie had still said i dont believe it who had found even
in that i dont believe it enough of strength to repudiate home and blood in order to champion his defiance and in which d bam
pion ing he proved his contention to be the fi ilse one and was more than ever interdict against returning home jus think of the
load he had to carry bom of two method is es or of one long invincible line of methodists and raised in provincial north mississippi
faced with incest incest of all things that might have been reserved for him dia tall his he ted it y and training had to
rebel against on principle and in as it tia don where he knew that neither incest nor training was going to help him solve it
so that maybe when they left and walked the streets th nh t and wb on said well now what henry said wait wattle t
me get used to it and maybe it was two days or three days and i tory said you shall not shall not and then
it was bon that said wait iam your older brother do you says hall nci tome and maybe it was a week maybe bon took
henry to see the oct oro on and henry looked at her and said that enough for you and bonsai d do you want it
te be enough and hairy said wait wait i must have time to get u to it you will have to give me time jesus
think how henry must have talked during that winter and then that spring with lincoln elected and the a lab a tna em vent ion
and the south began to draw out of the union and d ten there were two pies a dents in the united states and foe
te lee bz c the news about charleston and litt coin called out iii sai my and it was done irrevocable now and henry and
bon already decided togo without having to consult one another who would have gone anyway even if they had never seen one another but certainly
now because after all you dont waste a war tb in lc how a ey must have talked how henry would say but must you
marry her t do you have to do it and bon would say he should have told me he should have kl d me myself
himself i was for and honorable with him i waited you know now why i waited i gave him every chance to tell me him
s cebu the didnt do it if he had would have agreed and promised never to see her or you or him again but he
didnt tell mei thought at fi is t it was because he didnt know the nik new that he did know and still i waited
but he didnt tell me he just told you sent me a message like you send a command by anger servant to a bar or
a tramp to dear out dont you see that and hairy would say but judith our sister think of her and bon all right think
of her then what because they both knew what judith would do when she fm nd it out because they both ko ew that women
will show p rule and honor about almost anything except love and henry said yes i see i understand but you will have tome time
to get used to it you ate my older brother you can do that little fi arme think of the two of them bon who
didnt know what he was going to do and had to say pretend he did and henry who knew what he was going to do
and had to say he didnt then it was cfa xi in as amt hm zz and they hadn the ard from judith be causse
judith didnt know for sure whe m they were because henry would tft let bm write toho yet then they heard about the company the
uni vain ty grays organ iz bg up at oxford a ii d maybe tite y had been waiting for that sod tey to the
north mm wan de ett tr wai cr mt li fi boat now than cb xi stm a seven like it always is w ben
a war starts before the scene gets cluttered up with bad food and wounded soldiers and widows and orphans and them taking no part in
it now either but standing at the rail a gd n above the dni ming water and may lw it would be two or three
days then henry said suddenly cried suddenly but kin have done it ev m dukes i there was that lorraine duke named john something that
married his sister the pope ex con unu nica ted him but it didnt hurt it didnt hurt hi ey were still husband and wife
they were still alive they still loved then again loud fest but you will have to wait you will have to give me time maybe
the war will settle it and we wont need to and maybe this was one place where your oldman was tight and they rode into
oxford without touchings ut pens hundred and signed the company roster and thai hid somewhere to wait and henry let bon write judith one letter
they would send it by hand by a di at would steal into the quarters by night and give it to judith s maid and
judith sent the picture in the metal case and they rode on ahead to wait until the company got through making flags and riding about
the state telling ds farewell and started for the front jesus think of them because bon would know what henry was doing just as he
had always known what ha ury was thinking since that first daywhen they had looked at one another maybe he would know all the better
what henry was doing b use he did not know what he himself was going to do that he would not know until all of
a sudden someday it would hurst dear and he would know then that he had known all dbe time what it would be so be
didnt have to bother about himself and so all he had co do was just to watch i henry trying to recon dle what he
leary knew he was going to do all the vo fees of hoco li iy and training w bid bi said nono you ca mot
you must not you s hdl not maybe they would even be under fire now with the shells rushing and rumbling past overhead and bunting
and them lying there waiting to charge and henry would cry again but that lorraine duke did it there must have been lots indie world
who have done it that people dont know about hat maybe they suffered for it and di for it and are in hell now f
is c it but they did it and it dont matter now even the ones we do know about are just names now and it
dont matter now and bon watching him and listening to him and rbi tik in gls because i don tow myself what iam going to
do and so he is aware that iam undecided un th out knowing that he is aware perhaps if it old him now that iam
going to doi the would know his own mind and tell me you shall not and maybe your oldman was right r ii at time
and they did think maybe the war would settle it and they would not have to themselves or atleast maybe henry hoped it would because
maybe your oldman was rh there too and bon hid at cat et bar since both of the two people who could have ven him
a father had declined to do it nothing mattered to him now reverse or love or abs mee he knew now that leven ge could
not con q jens ate him nor love assuage maybe it w amt even h fen ry who wouldnt let him write to judi a
but bon himself who did not write her bec aum he didnt care a bm it anything not even that he didnt know yet what
he was going too then it was the next year and bon was an officer now and they were moving toward shiloh wu h out
know ii that either tall c in gaga in as they moved along in column t lw officer dropping back alongside the file in which
the private marched and henry crying again holding his desperate and urgent voice down to und ett one do at you know yet what you
at ego mg to dot while bern would look at him f is r with that es press km which could have been ff lai
bing suppose it old you i did not intend togo back to her and henry would walk there beside him with his pack and his
eight fat of musket and he would begin to pant panting and panting while bon watched him iam out in front of you a lot
now going into battle charging i will be out in front of you and henry panting stop stop and bon wat sch iii g him
with that faint thin expression about the mouth and eyes and who would ever know you would not even have to know for certain yourself
because who could say but what a yankee ball might have struck meat the exact second you pu u ed your trigger or even before
and henry panting and looking glaring at the sky with his teeth showing and the sweat on his face and the knuckles of the hand
on his musket butt white saying panting stop stop stop stop then it was shiloh the second day and the lost battle and the brigade
falling back from pittsburgh landing and listens hr eve cried wait now wait glaring at quentin panting himself as if he had had to supply
his shade not only with a cue but with breath to obey it in because your oldman was wrong here too he said it was
bon who was wounded but it wasnt because who told him who told s utp cn or your grand fr there it her which of
them it was who was hits ut pen didnt know because he wasnt there and your grandfather wasnt there eid i er because that was
where he was hit too where he lost his arm so who told them not henry because his fr di era ever saw henry but
that one time and maybe they never had time to talk about wounds and besides to talk about wounds in d he confederate army in
would be like coal miners talking about soot and not bon because s ut pen never saw him at all because he was dead it
was not bon it was henry bon that fr t md henry at last and s moped to np and henry fc hgb t back
say ii let be let me die i wont have to know it then and bonsai dso you do want me togo back to bet
and henry lay there struggling and panting with the sweat on his face and his teeth bloody inside his die wed lip and bonsai d
say you do want me togo back to her maybe then i wont do it say it and henry lay there struggling with the h
re shred stan ung through shirt and his teeth showing and the sweat on his ice until bon held his arms and lifted him on
to his back brat two of them then four now two again the room was m deed tomb like a quality stale and static and
moribund beyond any mere vivid and living cold yet they remained in it though not thirty feet away was bed and warmth quentin h not
even put on his overcoat which lay on the floor where it had fli lw om the arm of the chair where s hr eve
had pot it down they did not retreat om the cold they both bore it as though in deliberate flag d lant exaltation of physical
misery trans mo gri fie d into the spirits tr as of the two young men during that time fifty years a gpo rfb rt

a were already as oh mist ti hai dorus who wore plumes and cloaks lined with scarlet at twenty eight and thirty and thirty two
and captured warships with cavalry char but no grain nor meat nor bullets who would whip three separate armies in as many days and then
tear down their own fences to cook meat robbed fe om die ir own smokehouses who on one night and with a handful of men
would gallantly set fire to and destroy a million dollar garrison of enemy supplies and on the next night be discovered by a neighbor in
bed with his wife and be shot to death two four now two again according to quentin and s hr eve the two the four
the two still talking the one who did not yet know what he was going to do the other who knew what he would have
to do yet could not reconcile himself henry citing himself authority for incest talking about his duke john of lorraine as if he hoped possibly
to evoke that condemned and excommunicated de tote u him in person that it was all right as people both before and since have tried
to evoke god or devil to justify than in what their glands insisted upon the two the four the two facing one another in the
to mbh ke rooms hr eve the canadian the child of bl izz a urd s and of cold in a bathrobe with an overcoat
above it the collar turned up about his ears quentin the southerner the morose and def i cate of fip mg of rain and steamy
heat in the thin suitable do thing which he had brought fi rom mississippi his overcoat as thin and va infer what it was as
the suit lying on the floor where be had not even bothered to raise it winter of now the army re tre td across a
mia main to georgia now carolina was just td their harks and bon the of ker thinking we will either he c aug umd annihilate
or old joe wdl ex trias te us and we will make contort with lee in front of richmond raid then we wi u at
lea a have die priv i kg ef swr md ff and the none day all of a sudden hamm ht of it remembered haw
that jefferson regiment of which his father was now colonel was in long streets corps m td maybe from that moment the whole purpose of
the retreat seemed to him to be that of bringing him within re cuk of his father to give his father one more chance so
that it must have seemed to him now that he knew at last why he had not been a leto decide what he wanted to
do maybe he thoth t for just a second my god iam still young even after these four year siam still young hit just for
a second because maybe in the same breath he said au right then iam yot mg but i still believe eventhough what i believe probably
is that war suffering dte se four years of keeping his men alive and able in order to swap them blood and flesh for the
largest amount of ground at its bargain price will have changed him which i know that it does not do to where he will say
tome not forgive me but you are my oldest son protect your sister never see either of us again then it was aid what was
left of the army of t west with nothing remaining now but dte a bil hy to walk bark wards low and stubborn and to
endure musketry and shelling maybe they didnt even miss the shoes and overcoats and food anymore now and that was why he could write about
the capture do ove polish like he did in the letter to judith when he finally knew what he was going to do at last
and told b kn ry and henry stud thank god thank god not for the incest of course but because at last they were going
to do someday atlas the could be something eventhough di at something was the irrevocable repudiation cf the old heredity and training and the acceptance
of et emd damnation maybe he could even quit talking a out his lorraine duke dm because he add say now it isnt yours nor
his nor the pops hdl that we are all going to its my mothers and herm he ts and fra her s and the irmo
that s and father shell and it isnt you who are go mg there hut we the three no four of us and so at
lead we win all be her whe web dong since even if only he went there we would sts lh aue to he there too
since the dna of us are just i lb is ions that he begot and your illusions area part of you like your bones and
flesh and memory and we will all be together in torment and so we will not need to remember love and fornication and maybe in
torment you cannot even remember why you are there and if we cannot remember all this it cant be much torment then they were in
carolina that january and february of and what was left of them had been walking back iv ard for almost a year now and the
distance between them and richmond was less far th mi the distance they had come the distance between them and the end a good deal
less far but to bon it was not the space between them and defeat but the space between him and the other regiment between him
and the hour the moment he will not even have to ask me itv ill just touch flesh with him and i will say it
myself you will not need to worry she shall never see me again then march in carolina and still the walking backwards low and stubborn
and listening to the northward now because there was nothing to hear from any other direction because in all the other directions it was finished
now and all they expected to hear from the north was de fiat the none day he was a no j fl cer he would
have known heard that lee had detached some troops and sent them down to reinforce them perhaps he even knew the names and nun a
ers of die raiment s before they arrived he saws ut pen maybe that first times ut pena oud ly did not see him mt
be that first time he could tell himself that was why he didnt see meso that he had to put himself in s ut pens
way nu dte his chance and situation then for die second time he looked at the exp rest ion less md roc mike face at
the pale boring eyes in which there was no flicker nothing the face in which he saw his own features in w kid i he
saw recognition and that was all that was dl there was nothing jur die r now perl ups ht ju breathed once q me dy
with on his own face dutt expression which might at afi w ice have been cd led smiling while he dm gh ti cpu u
force km it coi mgo to him and force him imo wit gd ta the w om not hams e it was all fin id
t to tif d mt was all a fit nm and at lam and may he it was that same night or maybe a night
a week later while they were stopped because even sherman would have to stop sometimes at night with the ji res burning for warm that
least because atleast warm this d wap and doesnt remain consumed that bonsai d henry and said it wont be much longer now and dien
there won the anything left we wont even have an ph ing to do if i not even the privilege of w td king backward
slowly for a reason for the s dte of honor and what s left of pride not god evidently we have done without him for
four years only he just didnt tk ide to notify us and not only not shoes and clothing but not even any need for them
and not only noland nor anyway to make food but no need for die food since we have learned to live w idw ut that
too and so if you dont have god and you dont need food and clothes md skelter d tere isnt any dd ng for honor
and pride to climb on and hold to and flow risk and if y mt have nt get honor and pride then n tal d

it writ it so bm wrote the lem die pur years and he my read it aid mtu but d tey t md follow the
later they still w dk ed backwards low and stub bom listening toward the north for the end of it because it takes an aw
ji il lot of character to quit anything when you are losing and d tey had been walking backwards low for a year now so
all they had left was not the will but just the ability the grooved habit to endure the none night they had stopped again since
sherman i wd popped gain and an orderly came along the bivouac line and j mn dt kn rym last mds aids ut pen the
colonel wants you in his tent and so you and die old dame die aunt rosa want out there that night and the old clyde
tried to stop you stop her she held your armand said dont let her go up there young mars ter but you couldnt stop her
either because she was strong with forty five years of hate like forty five years of raw meat and all clyde had was just forty
five or fifty years of despair and waiting and you you didnt even want to be there at all to begin with and you couldnt
stop her either and then you saw that clyde s trouble wasnt anger nor even distrust it was terror fear and she didnt you in
so many words because she was s dll keeping that secret for the sake of the man who had been her father too as well
as for the sake of the family which no longer existed whose hare to fore inviolate and rotten mausoleum she still guarded didnt td ll
you in so many words anymore than she t did you in so many word shows he had been in the room di at day
whan they bro i ht sons body in and judith took f iom his pocket the x net al cases he had given him with
her it tc ture in it she didnt tell you it just came out of the terror and the f oara fier she turned you
loose and caught the aunt rosa s armand the aunt rosa turned and struck her hand away and went on to the stairs and clyde
tana the rand this time the aunt rce a stopped and turned on these coi jd step and kno cl ted clyde down with her
fist like a would and turned and went on up the stairs and clyde lay there on the floor more than eighty years old and
not mud h more than five feet tae and looking like a little bundle of clean rags so that you went and took her armand
helped her up and her arm felt like a sack as light and dr and brittle as a stick and she looked at you and
you saw it was not rage but terror and not terror because it was not about herself but was about whatever it was that was
upstairs that she had kept hidden up there for almost four years and she didnt tell you in the actual words because even indie terror
she kept the secret nevertheless she told you or atleast all of a sudden you knew s hr eve ceased again it was just as
well since he had no listener perhaps he was aware of it tt ran suddenly ik had no talker either though possibly he was not
aware of th because now neither of diem were there they were both in carolina and the rime was forty six years ago and it
was not even four now but compounded still further since now both of them were henry s ut pen and both of them were bon
compounded each of both yet either neither smell ti the very smoke which had blown and fed ed away f br ty a x years

his exchange though would presently hear the orderly pla m ly enough as he passes f iom fire to fire asking for s ut pen
and being directed on and so reaches the fire at last the smoldering log with his monotonous speech s ut pent m looking firs ut
pen until henry sits up and says here he is gaunt and ragged and unshaven because of the la kf out years and because he
had not quite go this height when die four years began he is not as tall by two inches as he gave promise f being
and not as heavy by thirty pounds as he pro hc my wdl be a few years t fier he has outlived the four years
if he do ou dive diem here he says what is it the colonel wants you the or de dy does not return with him

of them stand so looking at one another it is the older man who moves first though they meet in the t enter of the

which in the reflex instant abrogates and reconciles eventhough it does not yet perhaps never will j forgive who stands now while his father holds
his face between both hands looking at it henry s ut pen says my son then they s it one on either side of the

weary hack ward walking to commence again yet in a second tent candle gray and all are gone and it is the holly decked christmas
library at s ut pens hundred four years ago and the table not a camp table suitable for the spreading of maps but the heavy
carved rosewood one at home with the group photograph of his mother and sister and himself sitting upon it his father behind the table and
behind his father the window above the garden where judith and bon strolled in that slow rhythm wh re the heart matches the footsteps and
the eyes need only look at one another you are going to let him marry judith henry still henry does not answer it has all
been said before and now he has had four years of bitter struggle following which whether i the victory or defeat which he has gained
atleast he has gained it and has peace now even if the peace be mostly despair he cannot marry her henry now henry specks you
said that before it old you then and now and now it won the much longer now and then we wont have anything left honor
nor pride nor god since god quit us four years ago only he never though it necessary to tellus no shoes nor clothes and no
need fir them not only noland to make food out of but no need for the food and when you dont have god and honor
and pride nothing matters esa xp t that there is the old mindless meat that dont even care if it was dr feat or victory
that wont even died ud will be o td in the woods and fields gru laing uproots and weeds yes i have decided brother or
not i have decided i willi will he must not marry her henry yes i said yes at first but x was not derided then
i didnt kt him but now j have had four years to decide in i willi ant goh to he must not marry her henry
ms mot ke d ster to um edt at her mc ter had been a spanish woman i believed him it was mt until after
he was born that i found out that his mod wr was part neon or did henry ever say that he did not remember leaving
a e ten there men a ers all of i there members stooping th rou the entr aru x again and passing the sentry again
here members walking bade down the mt and rutted road stumbling in the dark among the ruts on either side of which the fires have
now died to embers so that he can bat ely dist in guidi the men sleeping on the earth ab of d them jt must
be better than eleven o clock he thinks and another eight miles tomorrow if it were only net for those damned guns why doesn told
joe give the guns to sherman then wem dd make twenty miles a day we could join lee then atleast lee stops and fights some
of the time here members i the remember show he did not return to his fire but slopped presently in a lonely place and leaned
against a pine leaning qui y and easily with his head hack so he could lookup a tae shabby sludgy branches like something in wrought
iron spreading mati o tdes s against the c hdl vivid stars of early spring thinking i hope here members to thank colonel willow for
letting us use his tent thinking not what he would do but what he would have to do beams e he knew what he would
do it now depended on what bon would do would force him to do since he knew a a the would do it so i
must goto him he thought a in ld ng now it is better than two o clock and it mil he dawn soon then it
was daw nord most and it was cold a chill which st tuck through the worn p ttt ched a indo amg through the something
of weariness and under nourishment the passive ability nae volition d will to endure there was light somewhere enough of it for him to distinguish
sons sleeping face from among a eo a ers where he iy mapped in his motets he nath his spread cloak enough u gm for
hm to wake bon by and for bon tt f diss anguish his face or perhaps something com mum cate d by henry shand because
bon does not speak demand to knot v tu ho it is he merely rises and puts the cloak about his shoulders and approaches the
smoldering f re and is kicking it into ablaze when henry speaks wait bon pauses and looks a the t try now he can see
henry s face he says you will be cold you are cold now you have nt been asleep have you here he swings the cloak
from his shot d der s and holds it out no henry says yes take it ill get my blanket bon puts the cloak about
henry and goes and takes up his tuna led blanket and swings it about his shoulders and they move aside and s it on a
log now it is dawn the east is gray it will be primrose soon and then red with firing and once more a e weary
backward marching will begin retreating from annihilation fid u ing bath upon dt at though not quite yet there will be a little time yet
for them to s it side by side upon the login a en ud d ngg fe of dawn the one in the doth the

send me to himno word to meno word at all that was dll he had to do now today four years ago or at anytime
during the four years that was dl he would not have needed to ask it rei ire it of mei would have offered it i
wcml d have said i will never see hrc in before h could have asked it of me he did not have to t lt
is henry he did st t need to t euyo ulama to stop me he u u have st is pp edme witko i a
that henry nal he my cries nono i uti otl l he springs up his face is leo rhin gb on can see his teeth
within the soft beard which covers his sunken cheeks and the whites of he t trys eyes as though die eyeballs struggled in their sockets
as the panting breath straggled in his lungs the panting which ceased the breath held the eyes too looking down at him where he sato
nike log the voice now not much louder than an expelled breath you said could have stopped you what do you mean by that now
it is bon who does not answer who sits on the log lo old ng at the face stooped above him henry says still in
that voice no louder than breathing but now you mean you yes what else can ido now i gave him the choice i have been
giving him the choke for four years think of her not of me of her i have for four years of you and her noi
via mdt in king of myself no henry says nono i cannot you shall not who will stop me skn ry nos kr try says
non ono now it is bon who watches henry he can see the whites of henry s eyes again ashes its looking at henry with
that expression wh kh might he called smiling his hand vanishes be sea dt the u an ket and reappears holding his pistol by the
barr d the butt extended toward henry do it now he says henry looks at the pistol new he is not only p cmt i
the is u en ming when he speeds now his voice is not even ike ex kde h law a is the su ff is
and suffocating in breath itself y mai my brother no im not im the th s going to sleep with you raster unless you stop
me henry suddenly henry grasps the pistol jerks it free of b anshan do and s so the pistol in his hand panting and panting
again bon can see the whites of his in roiled eyes while he sits on the log and watches henry with that faint expression about
the eyes and mouth which mig kbe smiling do it now henry he says henry whirls in the same motion he hurls the pistol from
him and stoops again gripping bon by both shoulders panting you shall no the says you shall not do you he arme bon does not
move beneath the gripping hands he sits motionless with his faint fx ed grimace his voice is gentler than that first breath in which the
pine branches begin to move a little you will have to stop me henry and he never sk ppe da ways hr eve said he
could have but he never even tried jesus maybe he even went to henry and said im going henry and maybe they left together and
rode side by side dodging yankee patrols all the way back to mississippi and right up to that gate side by side and it only
then that one of them ever rode ahead or dropped behind and that only then henry spurred ahead and turned his horse to ice bon
and took out the pistol and judith and clyde heard the shot and maybe wash jones was hanging a roi md somewhere m the backyard
and so he was there to help clyde and judith carry him into the house and lay him on the bed and wash went to
town to tell the aunt rosa and the aunt rosa comes boiling out that afternoon and finds judith stand ii without a tear bdb re
the closed door holding the metal cases he had given him with her picture in it but that didnt have her picture in it now
but that of the oct oro on and the hd and your oldman wouldnt know about that too why the black km a of bitch
should have taken har picture out and put the octo toons picture in so he invented a reason for it but i know and you
know too dont yo a i dont you huh he glared at quentin leaning forward over die table now looking huge and shapeless as a
bear in his swaddling of garments dont you know it was because he said to himself if henry dont mean what he said it will
be all right i can take it out and destroy it but if he does mean what he said it will be the only way
i will have to say to her i was m goo ido not grieve for main t that right a in t it by god

yes you dont know you dont even know about the old dame the aunt rosa miss rosa quentin said all right you dont even know
about her except that she ref ii sed at the last to be a ghost that after almost fifty years she couldnt reconcile he is
elf tok td ng him lie dead in peace that even after fifty years she not only could getup and go out there to finish
up what she found she had nt quite completed but she could find someone togo with her and bustin to that locked house because instinct
or some dung told her it was not finished yet do you no quentin said peacefully he could taste the dust even now with the
chill pure weight of the snow breathed new england a iron his face he could taste and feel die dust of that breathless rather furnace
breathed mississippi sep ten aber night he could even smell the old woman in the buggy beside him smell the fusty camphor reeking shawl and
ev m die airless bla dk cotton umbrella in which he would not discover until they had reached the houses he had concealed aha the
t and a flashlight he could smell the horse he could hear the dry plaint of the light wheels in the weigh des s per
meant dust and he seemed to feel the dust itself moves lt gish and dry across hh sweating flesh just as he seemed to hear
the single profound su spira don of the parched et u th s agony rising toward the imponderable and aloof stars now die spoke for
die first time since they had left je flers on rinc e she had climbed into the buggy with a kind of clumsy and fumbling
and trembling ea get ness which thought derived from terror dann until he found that he was quite wrong before he co um help her
to s it on the extreme edge of the seat small in the fusty shawl and clutching the umbrella leaning f br ward as if
by leaning forward she would arrive die sooner arrive immediately after die horse and before he quentin would before the prescience of her desire and
need could warn its consummation now she said we are on the domain on his land his and ellens and ellens descendants they have taken
it away from them since i understand but its dll belongs to him to ellen and her descendants but quentin was already aware of that
before she spoke he had said to himself now now and as during the long hot afternoon in died imho th t tle house it
seemed to him that if he stopped the buggy and hs ten ed he might even hear the galloping hod mh t even see at
any moment now die bl stallion and the rida r rush across the road before them and gallop on die rider who at one time
owned lode stock and hand everything he could see from a given poi ttt with every stick and blade and hoof and he don it
to remind him if he ever forgot it that he was the biggest thing in ih dr sight and in his own too who went
to war to protect it and lost the war and returned home to find that he had lost more than the war event hoi gh

if some tree gone vanished burned for warmth and food years ago now or perhaps just gone or if it had been one of the

had walked from the gate to the house as a child a boy when distances seem really long so that to the roan grown the

up aware of some feeble movement or intention in her limbs until he realized that she was trying to s it on the bottom st

paw you go up die re and m dte bar comedown make her go away from here whatever hedone me and judith and him have
paid it out you go and get her take if era way from here so he mounted die stairs the worn bare treads the cracked
and scaling wdl on one side the balustrade with its intermittent missing spindles on the other if c remembered how he looked back and she
was still sitting as he had left her and that now and he had not heard hun enter there stood in the hall below ahu

and slack mouthed idiot fec e he remembered how he thought the s don the heir the apparent thoth not obvious and how he heard
mrs cold fid ds feet and saw the light of the torch approach ii along the upper hall and how she came and passed him
how dbe stumbled a little and cath t herself and looked full at him as if she had never seen him before the eyes wide
and unseeing like a sleepwalkers the face which had always been tallow hued now possessing some s tih prof b under some almost unbearable quality
of bloodless nes and he th ott what what is it now its not shock and it never has bmi fear can it be triumph
and how she pae d him and went cm he heard c ly tie say to die man take her to gated b ty and

my face looks like her s did but its nott nu mph there was only c ly tic in the hall sitting still on the
bottom step sitting still in the attitude in which he had left her she did not even look at him when he passed her nor
did he overtake miss coldfield and the it was too dark togo fast though he could pre smt ly hear diem ahead of him she
was not using the flash bgh t now he remembered how he thought surely she cant be afraid to show a light now but she
was not using it and he wondered if she were holding to the negros mm now he wondered that until he heard the negros voice
flat without emphasis or interest w aw kin better over here and no answer from her though he was close enough now to hear or
believe he did her whimpering panting breath then he heard the other sound and he knew that she had stumbled and q en he could
almost sec the hulking slack faced stopped in his tracks loo lung toward the sound of the wait ii without interest or curiosity as he
qu mt in hurried forward hurried toward the voices you what s your names calls n te jim bond help me up you a in
t any s ut pen you dont have to leave me lying in the dirt when he stopped the buggy at her gates he did
no to fier to get out alone this time she s at die re until he got down and came round to her side she
sull s at i here clutching the umbrella in one hand and the hatchet in the other until he spoke her name then she stirred
he helped lifted her down she was almost as light as c ly tie had be m when she moved it was like a mad
ian kal d of lso that he supported and led b sr through the gate and up the short walk and into the dol is
i zi hot ese and turned on the light for her and looked at the fixed sleepwalk ir face the wide dark eyes as she
stood the rest ili clutch mg the umbrella and the hatchet the shawl and die black dress both stained with dirt where she had fallen
the black bonnet jerked fia r ward and awry by the shock of the fall are you all right now she said yes she said
yes i mall right goodnight not thankyou he thought just goodnight outside the house now breathing deep and fast no was he returned to the
buggy finding that he was about to begin to run thinking quietly jesus jesus jesus breathing fast and hard of the dark dead fu mac
cbr cath of air of night where the fierce aloof stan hung his own home was dark he was still using the whip when he
turned into the lane and then into the stable lot he sprang out and took them are from the buggy stripping the harness from her
and tumbling it into the harness room without stopping to hang it up sw cain g breathing fast and hard when he turned at last
toward the house he did begin to run he could not help i the was twenty years old he was not afraid because what he
had seen out there could not harm him yet her an even inside the dark familiar hou his shoes in his hand he still ran
up the stairs and into his room and began to undress bst sweating breathing fast i ought toba the he thought th a a he
was lying on the bed naked swabbing his body steadily with the disc ark d shirt sweating still panting sot when his eye muscles aching
and straining into dx e darkness and the almost dried shirt still clutched in his hand he said i have been asleep it was all
the same there was no difference waking or sleeping he walked dov ra that upper hall between the scaling walls and beneath the cracked ceiling
toward the fid nt light which fell outward from die last door and paused dki e saying nono a i ul then only it aw
sti have to and went in entered the bares tafe room whose shutters were closed too where a second lamp burned dimly on a crude
tabi c waking or sleeping it was the same the bed the yellow sheets and pillow the wasted yellow face vith closed almost transparent eyelids
on the pillow the wasted hands crossed on the breast as if he were already a corpse waking or sleeping it was the same and
would be the same forever as long as he lived and you are henry s ut pen aid you have been here four years and
you came home to di eyes to di eyes to die and you have been here four y em and you are henry s ut
pen it was quite cold in the room now the chimes would rir for one anytime now the chill had a compounded a gathered quality
as though preparing for the dead moment before dawn and she waited three months before she went b dc to get him s hr eve
said why did she do that t quentin sd nt answer he ky still and rigid on his back wi di the cold new england
night on his face and the blood running w ratm in his rigid body and limbs breathing hard but slow his eyes wide open up
tm the window thinking nevermore of peace nevermore of peace nevermore nevermore nevermore do you suppose it was because she knew what was go ii
to happen when she told it took an yaps dw t it would be over the nf in id band that had is bite dr
it hot mc ug s and she had used it so long that she did not dare risk cutting off the supply destroying the source
the very poppy s root and seeds oil quentin didnt answer but at last she did reconcile herself to it for his sake to save
him to bring him into town where the doctors could save him and so she told it then got the ambulance and the men and
went out there and old c ly tie maybe watching for just that out of the upstairs window for three months now and maybe even
your oldman was right this time and when she saw the ambulance turn into the gates he believed it was hat same black wagon for
which she probably had had that boy watching for three months now coming to carry henry into town for the white folks to hang him
for shooting charles bon and i guess it had been him who had kept that d lose t under the stairs full of tinder and
trash all that time too like she told him to maybe he not getting it the neither but keeping it fu h just like she
told him the kerosene and all for three months now until the hour when he could begin to howl now the chimes began ringing for
one o clo cls h rev ece adas if he were waiting for them to cease or perhaps were even listening to them quentin lay
still too as if he wem listening too though he was no the just heard them without listening as he heard s hr eve without
listening or answering until they ceased died away into the icy air delicate and faint and musical as struck glass and he quentin could see
that too though he had not been there the ambulance with miss coldfield between the driver and the second man perhaps a deputy sheriff in
the du w l surely and perhaps even with the umbrella too though probably no hatchet nor flashlight in it now entering the gate and
pi thing its way gingerly up the rutted and fiore n and n pw partially thawed drive and it may have been the howling or
it may have been the deputy or the driver or it may lave been she v ho cried first its on fire th ov ghs
he would not have cried that she would have said faster faster leaning forward on this seat too the small furious grim implacable woman not
much larger than ac hdd but die ambulance could not go ft in that drive doubtless c ly tie knew counted upon that it would
be a good three minutes before it could reach the house the monstrous tinder dry rotten shell seeping smoke through die warped cracks indie weather
boarding as if it were made of gauze wire and fu led with roaring and beyond which somewhere something lurked which bellowed something human since
the bellowing was in human speech eventhough die reason for it would not have seemed to be and the deputy and the driver would spring
out and miss coldfield would stumble out and follow them running too on to the gallery too where the creature w hid h bellowed foe
owed cm wraith hk e and insubstantial looking at them out of die smoke whereupon the deputy evo i turned and ran at him whereupon
he retreated ed though the howling did not diminish nor even seem to get any further away they ran on to th ellery too into
the seeping smoke miss coldfield screaming harshly the window the window to the second man at the door but the door was not locked it
swung inward die blast of heat struck them the entire staircase was on fire yet they had to hold her qu end n could see
it the lig j it thin furious creature making no sound a tae now struggling with silent and bitter fury da wing and scratching and
biting at the two men who held her who dragged her back and down the steps as the draft created by the open door seemed
to explode like powder among the flames as the whole lower hae vanished he quentin could see it could see the deputy holding her while
the driver backed the ambulance to safety and returned the three feces a eae ttl cw fl d now since they must have believed her
the three of them staring glaring at tiw doomed house and dia i for a moment maybe c ly tie appeared in that tv in
dow from which she must have been watching the gates constantly day and night for three months the tragic gnomes face beneath the clean head
rag against a red background office seen for a moment between two swirls of smoke looking do tv nat them perhaps not even now with
triumph and no more of despair than it had ever worn possibly even serene above the melting clapboards before the smoke swirled across it again
and he jim bond the s don the last of his race seeing it too now and howling with human reason now since now even
he could have known what he was howling about but they couldnt catch him they could hear him he didnt seem to ever get any
further away but they couldnt get any nearer and maybe in time they could not even locate the direction anymore of the howling they the
driver and the deputy held miss coldfield as she struggled he quentin could see her them he had not been there but he could see
her struggling and fighting like a doll in a nightmare making no sound foaming a little at the mouth her face even indie sunlight lit
by one last wild crimson reflection as the house collapsed and roared away and there was only the sound of the idiot lef land so
it was the aunt rosa that came back to town inside the ambulances hr eve said quax tin did not answer he did not even
say miss rosa he just lay there staring at the window without even blinking breathing the chill heady pure s rio wka med darkness and
she went to bed because it was all finished now there was nothing left now nothing out there now bit t that idiot boy to
lurk around dio a ashes and those four gutted chimneys and howl until someone came and drove hun away they couldnt catch him and nobody
ever seemed to nuke him go very fir away he just stopped howling for a little while uk n after a while foe y wo
idd be to hear him again and so she died qt bsn tin did not answer staring at the window then he could not tell
if it was the actual tain dow or the windows pale rectangle upon his eye hds though after a moment it gan to emerge it
began to take shape in its same curious light gravity defying attitude the once folded sheet out of the wistaria mississippi summer the cigar smell
the random blowing of die fireflies the south s hr eve said the south jesus no wonder you folks all outlive yourselves by years and
years and years it was becoming quite distinct he would be able to decipher the words soon in a moment even almost now now now
iam older at twenty than a lot of people who have died quentin said and more people have died than have been twenty ones hr
eve said now he quentin could read it could finish it the sloped whimsical ironic handout of mississippi attenuated into their on snow or perhaps
there is surety it can harm noone to he tie ve that perhaps she has escaped not at all the privilege of being outraged and
amazed and of not forgiving but on the contrary has herself gained that place or bourne where the objects of the outrage and of the
commiseration cd so are no longer ghosts but are actual people to be actual recipients of the hatred and the pity it will do no
harm to hope you see i have written hope not think so let it be hope that the one cannot escape the censure which no
doubt he deserves that the other no longer lack the commiseration which let us hope while we are hoping that they have longed for if
only for the reason that they are about to receive it whether they will or no the weather was be aut if id though cold
and they had to use picks to break the earth for the grave yet in one of the deeper do ds is aware d worm
doubtless alive when the dod was thro um up though by if te moon it was frozen again so it took charles bon and his
mother to get rid of old tom and charles bon and the oct oro on to get rid of judith and gb arles bon and
c ly tie to get rid of henry and c tt aries bons mother and charles bons grandmother got rid of charles bon so it
takes two to get rid of ones utp end on tite quentin did not answer evi den dys hr eve did not want an answer
now he continued almost without a pause which is all right its fine it clears the whole ledger you can tear all the pages out
and bum them except for one thing and do you mow what that is j perhaps he hoped for an answer this time or perhaps
he merely paused for emphasis since he got no answer you ve got one left one ut pen left of course you cant catch him
and you dont even always see him and you never will be able to use him but you ve got him there still you still
hear him at night sometimes dont you yes quentin said and so do you know what i think now he did expect an answer and
now he got one no quentin said do you want to know what i think no quentin said then ill tell you i think that
in time the jim bonds are going to conquer the western hemisphere of course it wont quite it e in our time and of course
as they spread toward the poles they will bleach out again like the rabbits and the birds do so they wont show up so sharp
against the snow but it will still be jim bond and so in a few thousand years i who regard you will also have sprang
f iom the loins of afi i can kin now i want you tome just one tiling more why do you hate the south i
don that e it quentin said quickly at once i mm edit yi don that ei the said i don that ei the thought panting
in the cold air their on new england dark i don tid on tid hate it i don that e it
